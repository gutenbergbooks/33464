<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago it was suggested, by certain rose-lovers
and enthusiasts, that the practical experience
of an amateur, brought up from childhood to love and
cultivate roses, might be of use to other owners of
small gardens, who, like herself, tend their roses
themselves. And in the hope that this might be
the case, I undertook to write this little book. My
text-book in this labour of love has been an old copy,
which belonged to my father when he settled at
Eversley in 1844, of <i>The Rose Amateur's Guide</i>,
by that veteran rose-grower, the late Thomas Rivers.
I am also greatly indebted to the Rev. J. H. Pemberton's
learned and admirable work, <i>Roses, their
History, Development, and Cultivation</i>, published
early this year; and to the various publications of
the National Rose Society.</p>

<p>As one branch, however, of the cultivation of roses
is a sealed book to me, for I am only an amateur who
does not exhibit, I felt that no work on rose-growing
would be complete without a chapter which should
help those who wish to do so. And here I was indeed
fortunate in obtaining the help of so distinguished an
authority as my friend and neighbour, Rev. F. Page-Roberts,
Vice-President of the National Rose Society.
My grateful thanks are due to him for the delightful
chapter, the last in the book, on "How to grow
Roses for Exhibition." And I feel that to have his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
name on the title-page is an honour of which I cannot
be too proud.</p>

<p>As to the illustrations, it should be borne in mind
that they are not intended to represent exhibition
roses, but merely ordinary blooms, typical of the
various kinds of garden roses. The colour prints
have been admirably carried out by Messrs. Swain
and Son of Barnet, by their new process of colour-printing.
My friend, Miss Emily Jubb, has supplied
several of the original photographs of roses
and of pruning, from specimens in my own garden;
and to her I offer my warm thanks. Thanks are also
due to Mr. Wm. Paul of Waltham Cross nurseries,
and to Mr. Henry Nicholson of New Barnet, for
their kindness in furnishing Messrs. Swain and Son
with all the other specimen flowers for the plates.
In fact, without Mr. Nicholson's ready help in
a supplying a large proportion of the subjects from
his own garden, it would have been difficult to
carry out the scheme of illustration.</p>

<p>If this humble record of my own practical experience,
its failures, and its successes, is the means of
encouraging others in the cultivation of roses, I can
only wish them the interest, delight, and healthful
relaxation of tired body and mind, which this pursuit
has afforded me for many a long year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MAKING AND PLANTING A ROSE GARDEN</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Happy</span> is the rosarian who is free to choose the
spot in which to make his rose garden&mdash;to choose the
ideal position, with ideal soil, in an ideal climate.
Such fortuitous combinations are possible. But
though they do not fall to the lot of one rose-lover
in a hundred, it is still easy to find a bit of ground
in which roses will flourish; for, with proper care,
there are few localities&mdash;in England at all events&mdash;where
they cannot be made to grow. At the same
time, in choosing the position of our rose garden,
certain dangers must be guarded against, as far as
possible.</p>

<p><b>Position.</b>&mdash;First of all I would say, avoid a
draughty spot; for nothing is so bad for roses as a
draught. Even an exposed garden, if it is quite flat
and open, is preferable to a draughty one, however
picturesquely shaded it may be. The perfect position
should be sheltered from the north and east: but not
closely surrounded by trees. For roses are lovers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
light and sun; and while they enjoy a little shade
for a few hours in the day, they will not flourish in
stuffy, closely shadowed places, where they cannot
get enough light and air.</p>

<p><b>Shelter.</b>&mdash;If some sort of shelter is absolutely
imperative, there are various ways of producing it
without putting up an unsightly paling, or building
a costly wall in the garden. One of the best is a low
hedge kept closely clipped, of yew, holly, privet, or
beech&mdash;the first is, of course, slow in growth. Care,
however, must be taken to plant the hedge at such a
distance from the rose beds that its roots shall not
suck all the nourishment from them. But nothing is
more charming or suitable than to give the choice and
more tender roses a shelter of roses&mdash;planting the
strong-growing Wichuraianas, Ramblers and other
vigorous kinds along a screen of wooden lattice-work.
This not only makes a quite sufficient break to the
wind, but forms a delightful background to the beds
of dwarf roses.</p>

<p>If possible, the ground should slope very gently to
south and west. Flat ground is preferable to any
slope steeper than one in fifty. But some slight fall
is extremely advantageous, as it helps drainage.</p>

<p><b>Drainage.</b>&mdash;This is another most important point
to be considered. For whether the soil be light or
heavy, it is absolutely essential that a rose garden
should be well drained; as roses so deeply resent
wet about the roots, that they promptly show their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
displeasure by dying. If, therefore, on low-lying land&mdash;and
unfortunately we cannot always avoid this&mdash;there
is any suspicion of water within three feet of
the surface, broken crocks, clinkers, wood ashes, and
such-like materials, must be placed at the bottom of
the beds to keep the subsoil free in times of heavy
rain and floods; and a good drain of ordinary field
pipes must be run from the beds into the nearest
ditch. For let it be remembered that if we intend to
grow good roses, we must be prepared to do our very
best for them, and to spend a little time, a little
money, and a good deal of thought, on preparing the
ground they are to grow in, before we dream of
planting them. Far better to begin our garden with
a dozen roses well planted in properly prepared
ground, than with a hundred put in anywhere
and anyhow.</p>

<p>This brings us to the next point&mdash;</p>

<p><b>The Soil</b>,&mdash;which is far more important than even
the position of our garden. If we are so lucky as
to be able to choose the soil as well as the position,
then let us choose a rich brown loam; for that is
the soil roses revel in and need but little else to
nourish them. Such a soil as this we find in the
famous rose-gardens of Essex, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire,
and Kent. I have even seen roses growing
superbly, without manure of any kind, in an open
field of this rich loam on one of the most exposed
ridges of Warwickshire. But if such natural soil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cannot be had, we must make it, as I know to my
cost; for in my own garden the ground is so poor
that every rose-bed has to be made three feet deep.
And nothing in this case produces such excellent
results as the top spit of an old pasture. To get
this, the turf should be pared off carefully, and
then the first nine inches of brown fibrous loam
beneath taken out. If the space thus left is filled up
with other common soil, the turf can be relaid, and
no harm is done to the meadow. If, on the other
hand, the turf is not needed in the same spot, it may
be stacked in a heap&mdash;grass downward&mdash;and kept for
a couple of years till it has rotted down completely;
when, mixed with manure, it makes perfect potting
soil, or the finest possible dressing for our rose beds.
In the neighbourhood of towns and villages, where
building is going on, this turfy loam is often to be
had when new roads are cut out and houses run up.
And it is well worth the rosarian's while to be on the
watch for such opportunities, and secure a few loads
of the top spit from the builder, to stack in the garden
against the time it is needed.</p>

<p>Having provided the requisite soil, we are now
ready to begin work by making the beds. The
general arrangement of the garden, the shape and size
of the beds has to be determined. And here, of course,
the rosarian must be guided by his own taste. A few
hints, however, from personal experience may be helpful.
As to shape, that is purely a matter of taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
But whether they be round or square, straight or
curved, in size they should not be too large or too
wide to allow of our getting easily at their precious
contents. For <i>at all times of the year</i> roses need
constant and watchful care; and the amateur&mdash;especially
if a woman, hampered with tiresome petticoats&mdash;must
have space in which to move, in order to pick
off caterpillars, cut the flowers whether alive or dead,
and see to all the various needs of the plants, such as
weeding, watering, manuring and pruning. As to
width, I find five feet ample in a small garden; as
that allows of three rows of dwarf plants eighteen
inches to two feet apart; and enables me to reach
those in the centre row without injuring the others.</p>

<p><b>Making the Beds.</b>&mdash;Let us therefore suppose we
are about to make a straight bed five feet wide and
twelve long, in hitherto unbroken ground, to contain
seventeen roses. The first thing to do is to pare off
the turf. The top spit of some eight or nine inches
below it, is sure to be fairly good soil from the fibrous
roots of the grass and clover. We therefore dig it off
a space three feet long and the whole width of the
bed, and wheel it down to the further end. The
second spit in such land as my own garden is much
poorer, with a good deal of sandy marl in it. This
is taken right out and heaped at the side of the bed,
to be taken away later on. The third spit, which
is now exposed, is a cold, sandy marl, with many
stones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>We have therefore a hole five feet wide, a yard in
length, and two feet deep. If the marl at the bottom
does not show any sign of water, it may be broken up
with the fork, mixing in a little manure at the same
time, and we can leave it as it is. If, on the other
hand, it is full of water, some of it must be carted
away, and crocks, stones, clinkers, wood ashes, and
even bits of turf, grass downwards, put in below to
drain it, as I have already said.</p>

<p><b>Bastard Trenching.</b>&mdash;We then begin the regular
process of bastard trenching, digging up the fourth
foot of top soil, throwing it into the hole, mixing it
with the broken marl and manure at the bottom,
and then removing the second spit as directed
above. This is done along the whole bed; and at
the end we use some of the earth we wheeled down
at the beginning, to fill the hole on the marl at the
bottom.</p>

<p>We thus have a bed five feet by twelve, but some
fifteen inches below the ground. Over the surface of
this bed we now spread a coating of good rotten
manure; if we can get it from a cow yard so much
the better, as cow manure is cooler than horse
droppings to the roots of the roses. This must be
thoroughly incorporated with the soil already dug in,
with a fork, not a spade, as our object is to keep the
earth as friable as we can. The bed is then filled up
with nothing but the turfy loam mixed with some of
the best of the surface soil, till it rises a little above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the level of the surrounding ground; for it will be
sure to sink.</p>

<p>But let no one imagine that this bed is ready for
planting. It must be left for at least a fortnight (a
month is better) to settle, and to mellow and sweeten;
while its surface must be left quite rough to aid the
process. If there is a frost during this settling, that
will do it the greatest possible good.</p>

<p>Let the amateur avoid all artificial manures at first
save a dusting of basic slag (see <a href="#Page_151">Chap. XI</a>); for there
is no need whatever in preparing a new rose bed to
use any manure except sweet stable and cow manure.
This contains all the qualities needful for newly-planted
roses. It should, however, be so worked into
the soil as not to come into actual contact with their
roots, but to lie some two or three inches below them.</p>

<p>I have, of course, chosen an extreme case here.
Better ground only needs to be thoroughly dug two
spits deep, with manure and fibrous loam worked in.
But, even so, I always think it is advantageous to
break the ground at the bottom with a fork.</p>

<h3>PLANTING.</h3>

<p>When the beds are thoroughly prepared and settled,
we may begin to think about planting them.</p>

<p>The ideal time for this operation is in November
and December. For the plants, lifted as soon as they
have done flowering, and put in their new quarters
with as little delay as possible, have time to settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
down before any very severe weather, and suffer far
less than those planted later in the winter. But
roses can be safely planted, if proper precautions are
taken in the process, as late as February and March&mdash;open
weather of course being selected for the process;
and I have indeed planted them late in April
without damage: but that was of course taking a big
risk as a matter of necessity.</p>

<p>Whether we get our roses from British or from
foreign growers, the orders should be sent out as early
as possible in September and October, to secure the
best plants and to ensure their arrival in good time.</p>

<p>A mild day, if possible without sun, is best for
planting roses. And if the bundles arrive in a frost
it is better not to attempt to open them, but to put
them just as they are into some outbuilding in which
the frost cannot get at them, where they may safely
stay for several days.</p>

<p><b>Unpacking.</b>&mdash;When they arrive, the bundles must
be opened most carefully, and the packing removed
gently. I have seen valuable roses badly broken by a
careless person, who has pulled them roughly out of
the package instead of quietly disentangling the
shoots. If the journey has been a long one, the
plants should be well syringed at once, and the roots
plunged in a bucket of water for half-an-hour before
planting. Great care must also be taken in every
case not to leave the roots of the plants exposed to
the air; for if the roots get dried up, a great and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sometimes fatal check is given to the rose. Those which
cannot be planted immediately should be laid along a
trench and lightly heeled in with soil, until they are
wanted. And even those which are to be planted
immediately, should have a mat thrown over the roots
as they lie beside the bed waiting their turn, especially
if the day is sunny or the wind cold. Many
of the great growers advise dipping the roots in
liquid mud mixed with a little cow manure before
planting.</p>

<p>Each plant must now be carefully examined, and
any broken shoot, or bruised and broken root, cut off
with a clean cut. For this I prefer a s&eacute;cateur to a
knife, if the s&eacute;cateur is a very sharp one.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A torn,
bruised, or broken root, if left on the plant will decay
right up and do incalculable mischief. Sometimes, in
the case of one's own roses grown from cuttings out of
doors, the roots are so rampant that it is well to
shorten them before replanting; but this is not often
necessary with new stock from the growers.</p>

<p>The holes must now be dug ready for the reception
of each plant. In well-worked ground, such as the
new bed described above, a hole eighteen inches across
and eight inches to one foot in depth, is sufficient:
but in this we must be guided by the root habit of
each plant. Some have roots of a spreading nature;
others are deep rooting. And the idiosyncrasy of each
individual rose must be studied, if we wish it to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
happy. In an old bed it is well to break the ground
all about the hole with a fork; as the roots can then
penetrate the surrounding soil with ease. And I
would repeat that when the hole is made ready for its
occupant, we should see that no manure is on the
surface upon which the roots will lie.</p>

<p><b>Planting</b>, to be well done, needs two persons.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the plant, held in the left hand,
is set exactly in the centre of the hole, while with the
right the roots are spread out flat in all directions, so
that none are bent or twisted or allowed to cross, but
are so arranged that the rose gets proper support on
all sides. In fact they should be regarded as the guy-ropes
of a flagstaff, intended to hold the plant firm
from all points. If a root is too long to lie at its
full length in the hole, instead of trying to fit it in
against its natural inclination by turning it round the
side of the hole, a further little channel must be dug
in which it can lie perfectly flat. And great care
must be taken not to injure the little white, fibrous
rootlets, which mean flowering strength for the
coming season.</p>

<p>The collar, or point at which the dwarf rose is budded
on to the briar, should be from one to three inches below
the surface of the soil when the planting is completed.
In newly made ground I prefer three inches, as the
soil always sinks a little. This is enough; for the
plant should never be <i>buried</i>, and the roots should be
kept as near the surface as possible. But if the collar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
is above the ground, the stock begins to throw suckers
which take all its strength, and the scion perishes.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/ill-0027.png" width="370" height="500" alt="Fig. 1.&mdash;Mode of Planting a Standard Rose." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Mode of Planting a Standard Rose.</span>
</div>

<p>When the rose is properly set out and still held
firmly in position, the second planter sprinkles some
fine good soil among the roots&mdash;I generally give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
plant a little gentle lifting shake at this point, to allow
the fine earth to fall into all the interstices of the
roots. He then fills up the hole gradually, pressing
down the soil firmly at first with the hand, and when
all is on treading it down with the foot, thus making
the plant absolutely firm in its place before number
one lets go his hold on it.</p>

<p>If their roots have been thoroughly soaked and
swelled before planting, the roses need not be watered.
But if the weather is dry, yet mild, it is well to give
them a good syringing when they are all in place,
especially if they have come a long journey. This,
however, must be done in the forenoon, to allow them
to dry before any chance of a chill during the night.</p>

<p>In the case of standards, large bushy plants, or
pillar roses, a stake should be put against them before
the hole is filled with earth. This is far the most
satisfactory plan, as it avoids the chance of bruising
or breaking the roots if the stake is forced in among
them after planting. And, as I have said, the more
fine fibrous roots the plant can throw, the better the
flowers it will bring.</p>

<p>Tarred twine, or Raffia tape, are the best materials
for tying standard and pillar roses. The twine should
be given a double twist round the stake and then tied
firmly round the stem, but not too tight, so as to
allow room for the stem or branch to swell.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances must wire be used.</p>

<p>In the case of roses taken out of pots, the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of spreading the roots is one of the utmost importance;
as, if they have been long in a pot the roots are
interlaced in a perfect ball, and need most careful
handling to avoid breaking them.</p>

<p>When all are safely in place, the tickets must be
taken off and replaced by labels stuck in the ground
beside each plant.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Many roses, especially from
abroad, come with labels fastened on with wire.
These should be removed without delay; for the
moment the shoots begin to swell the wire eats into
them, and in the course of a few months will either
kill the shoot or break it. This is a most important
matter. And I have had sad experience in it; as
owing to carelessness and hurry in planting a number
of extremely good French roses, I overlooked some of
the wired labels. Eight months later, half&mdash;and the
larger half&mdash;of a fine plant in full flower of the dwarf
Polyantha, <i>Perle des Rouges</i>, was broken off on a
windy day; and on examination I found that the
stem had swelled to such a size round the corroding
wire, that the weight it was bearing of foliage, flowers,
and branches had broken it clean off. Even a label
tied on with a string is injurious, from the constant
chafing of the bark as the wind blows it to and fro
and tightens the knot.</p>

<p>Our heavy task being now accomplished, we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
await the rigours of winter cheerfully. But let no one
persuade us that the newly planted beds would look
better if raked smooth instead of being left quite
rough. A smooth rose bed means that the soil cakes
hard, preventing the rain penetrating in summer, and
the frost mellowing the ground in winter. And from
early spring to late autumn the hoe should be kept
constantly at work between the plants; not merely to
keep down weeds, but to keep the surface of the
ground open to the influences of rain, sun, and the
watering-pot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PRUNING AND PROPAGATING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the many toils and anxieties that beset the
path of the amateur rosarian, I think we may safely
say pruning is the chief. The rules to be observed
are few. The idiosyncrasies of each rose are many.
And the demands upon one's own judgment and
initiative are constant.</p>

<p>Two things have to be considered before we begin
the puzzling task. Are we growing our roses for
exhibition, or at all events for a very few very
perfect blooms? Or are we growing them for
quantity, for mere enjoyment, on the "cut and come
again" principle, which enables one not only to fill
the house without robbing the garden, but to fill the
hands of every one who comes into the garden and
looks at the masses of blossom with longing eyes?</p>

<p>As I do not exhibit, the second plan is the one I
have studied most closely. For the other I must refer
my readers to my friend the Rev. F. Page-Roberts'
valuable notes, on how to grow and show roses in
Chapter XI.</p>

<p><b>When to prune.</b>&mdash;The old-fashioned plan of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pruning all roses in the autumn has now been, happily
for their well-being, given up in England. It was
owing to this that many of the earlier varieties of
Tea roses, and even some of the Bourbons and Hybrid
Perpetuals, were considered 50 years ago too "tender"
to plant freely out of doors.</p>

<p>Pruning now begins in February, and goes on
through March and April.</p>

<p>In February we begin to prune the <i>Rugosas;</i>
<i>Boursaults;</i> <i>Sempervirens;</i> and <i>Ayrshires</i>.</p>

<p>In February and early March, the <i>Provence;</i> <i><a href="#Moss_Common">Moss</a>;</i>
<i>miniature Provence;</i> many of the Species, such as
<i>Alpina</i>, <i>Moschata</i>, and <i>Bracteata</i>, and their hybrids.</p>

<p>In early March the <i>Gallica;</i> <i>Damask;</i> <i><a href="#ROSA_ALBA">Alba</a>;</i>
<i>Hybrid Chinas;</i> and <i>Sweet Briars</i>. To be followed
by <i>Hybrid Bourbons;</i> <i>Hybrid Noisettes</i> and <i>Musks;</i>
<i>Austrian</i> and <i>Scotch Briars;</i> <i>Multifloras;</i> <i>Ramblers;</i>
<i>Wichuraianas;</i> <i>Chinas;</i> <i>Dijon Teas;</i> <i>dwarf
Polyanthas;</i> and dwarf and standard <i>Hybrid Perpetuals</i>
and <i>Hybrid Teas</i>.</p>

<p>Climbing varieties of <i>Noisettes</i>, <i>Teas</i>, <i>Hybrid
Teas</i>, and <i>Hybrid Perpetuals</i>, may be thinned out,
if necessary, after flowering in summer. But they
must be pruned in March.</p>

<p>In April the <i>Teas</i> and <i>Noisettes</i>, both dwarf and
standard, and the <i>Banksian roses</i> are pruned.</p>

<p><b>How to prune.</b>&mdash;This is a much-disputed subject
among rose growers, and as authorities differ widely
with regard to it, some advocating hard pruning, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
others just as strongly swearing by light pruning, so
do they differ as to the instrument to be used. The
pruning knife is most generally recommended; while
the s&eacute;cateur, so universally in use on the Continent, is
advised merely for the cutting of dead wood. But the
knife has its disadvantages, especially in the hands of a
woman. For not only may one get an ugly cut with it:
but even in a man's hands I have seen the plant pulled
about more than I like, in cutting a tough branch. I
am therefore delighted to find that so great an
authority as the Rev. J. H. Pemberton advocates the
use of the s&eacute;cateur for <i>all</i> pruning, as for many years
I have used nothing else. The amount of time and
strength it saves one is infinite, to say nothing of the
comfort of so handy a weapon.</p>

<p>There are, however, s&eacute;cateurs and s&eacute;cateurs&mdash;and a
poor one is worse than useless. Its blades must be
as sharp as a razor, and so accurately set that they
make a perfectly clean cut right through, without
pinching the branch or tearing the bark. In choosing
one, it is well to try it on a sheet of tissue paper. If
it cuts the paper like a sharp pair of scissors, it is all
right. But if it curls the paper round the blade,
instead of making a clean cut, it is to be avoided.
After trying many different makes, I have found that
the <i>S&eacute;cateur Montreuil</i>, which I have now procured for
several years from MM. Vilmorin, Andrieux et Cie.,
4, Quai de la Megisserie, Paris, is far the best I can
get. It costs 8 francs, and is made in three sizes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>As to hard-and-fast rules in pruning, there are but
two.</p>

</table></div>

<p>1. Prune weak-growing roses much harder than
strong-growing roses. As the object of pruning is
to throw the sap into the young shoots which will
start from the dormant buds or "eyes," in order to
make them flower, a weak-growing rose must be
pruned hard so as to concentrate all the vigour of the
plant on the few dormant buds we leave. While
if we prune a strong-growing rose very hard we
only make it throw yet longer shoots, which soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
get out of all bounds, and run to wood and not to
blossom.</p>

<p>2. Always prune to a dormant bud which points
outwards. This is done to keep the centre of the plant
comparatively free, by preventing the shoots crossing
and choking each other.</p>

<p>In pruning we have to keep two objects ever in
view. In the first place we must prune in order to
get rid of all dead wood, and weak, unripe and useless
shoots, thus enabling the young healthy wood to take
their place. And secondly we must prune so as to
keep the plant in good shape and good health, by
cutting back the strong and healthy wood we leave to
a suitable length.</p>

<p>If the winter has been mild, we shall find many
buds on the upper part of strong shoots of last year's
growth, which are already bursting into leaf and even
showing a flower bud. And it seems so brutal to
destroy these, that I know one is often tempted to
leave some to take their chance, instead of hardening
one's heart and sternly cutting down to just above the
first dormant bud. But when the plants really start
in May, we pay for our tender-hearted folly by blind
unhealthy shoots which only disfigure the plant, while
the real flower shoots are starting below and cannot
get up to the light and air. Or, again, the unpruned
shoot turns black and begins to die back, and we have
to cut it down much further than would have been
necessary had we pruned it at the right moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>In pruning, however, let the amateur remember
that until he has gained considerable experience in
the matter, it is far safer to prune too lightly than to
prune in excess. And I must repeat that no rules
will really help us, unless we study the special nature
and idiosyncrasy of each individual plant, exactly as
we study the character of the child we have to deal
with.</p>

<p>With climbing summer-flowering roses very little
pruning at all is required, except slightly shortening
the ends of the long rambling shoots, cutting out all
the dead wood, and cutting some of the old flowering
shoots which are worn out, down to the base.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Ramblers, Noisettes,
and other climbing roses bear their flowers on the
laterals of the long shoots of the former year. While
the Banksias, some of the Multifloras such as <i>Aglaia</i>,
and that beautiful rose <i>Fortune's Yellow</i>, only flower
on the sub-laterals, <i>i.e.</i> on wood three years old. If
therefore these shoots are cut back too hard the plant
does not flower.</p>

<p>One of the finest specimens of <i>Crimson Rambler</i> I
have ever seen, was ruined for several years by an
ignorant person who carefully and triumphantly cut
out all the long shoots of the former year, which he
considered mere "sucker rods." And then he was
surprised at the plant bearing no flowers.</p>

<p>A certain amount of very useful minor pruning can
be carried on all through the summer, by cutting out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
bits of old wood when they have flowered, if we see
that they have no young shoots on which to bear a
second crop later on. For instance when the newer
China roses, such as <i><a href="#Laurette_Messimy">Laurette Messimy</a></i>, are in full
bloom, we often find a bit of one of last year's growths
which has borne one or two of the earliest flowers and
now merely blocks up the young tender shoots full of
buds. This is the time to cut it out, instead of allowing
it to absorb part of the strength which should go to
the new wood.</p>

<p><b>Cutting off dead blooms.</b>&mdash;Though to some it
may seem a small matter, much good may also be
done to our plants through the summer by the way
we remove dead flowers. Instead of merely snapping
off each blossom between thumb and finger, it is
better to do a little very mild pruning, by cutting
each dead blossom off just above the second leaf below
it. This greatly promotes the autumn blooming of
the plants, and keeps them in good shape. It is a
little more trouble, but amply repays us in the end.</p>

<p>The precise moment of setting to work must depend
to some extent on the weather. Of course we cannot
begin in a heavy frost, as that would be fatal to the
plants. Nor can I go as far as Mr. Pemberton, who
with delightful enthusiasm advises us to choose a cold
day with north-east wind and occasional sleet showers.
That is too complete a counsel of perfection for most
mortals; for however much they love their roses,
they equally dread pneumonia for themselves. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
certainly a cool, overcast day is best, as there is less
chance of the wood bleeding than in mild, soft
weather.</p>

<p>Well prepared, therefore, s&eacute;cateur in hand, and
knife in pocket in case of need, with strong gloves and
old clothes, and if a woman, with a housemaid's kneeling
pad to kneel on so as to get more easily at the
dwarf plants&mdash;for pruning is tiring work in any case,
and it is well to save extra fatigue and backache&mdash;we
now begin on a late February day, with</p>

<p><b>Rugosa</b> Roses.&mdash;These need little pruning beyond
cutting out the dead wood, and cutting back some
of the old wood almost to the base, when it will throw
up fresh shoots which will bloom late. The suckers
which these roses throw up in numbers, may be cut
back to three or four feet to form a thick bush.</p>

<p><b>Ayrshires</b> and <b>Sempervirens</b>.&mdash;Thin out
slightly and cut out dead wood&mdash;no further pruning
is needed.</p>

<p><b>Boursaults</b> need no thinning. The flowers are
borne on the laterals of last year's long shoots, which
may be left six to ten feet long.</p>

<p>The <b>Species</b> and most of their hybrids need no
pruning beyond cutting out dead wood, and occasionally
cutting the young base shoots back to hard, well-ripened
wood, when the tips are touched by frost.</p>

<p><b>Provence</b> and <b>Moss</b> Roses.&mdash;Cut out old wood;
thin out old shoots, and out back the young base
shoots and laterals to four or six eyes. Some of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
strong-growing moss roses may be left taller. The
<b>Perpetual Moss</b> roses are pruned as hybrid perpetuals
for garden decoration.</p>

<p><b>Miniature Provence.</b>&mdash;Keep well pruned to
within six inches of the ground, and thin out the
centre.</p>

<p><b>Gallica</b> and <b>Damask</b>.&mdash;Prune lightly. The
strong growers may be kept as tall bushes or pillars.
The dwarf, such as <i><a href="#Gallica_Red_Damask">Red Damask</a></i>, and <i>Rosa Mundi</i> cut
back to three feet. Keep the best one- and two-year-old
shoots and laterals, and thin out old and weak
wood.</p>

<p><b>Alba.</b>&mdash;Grow as bushes or pillars five to six feet
high, cutting out weak wood, leaving all the laterals
on which the flowers are borne, about eight inches to
one foot.</p>

<p><b>Hybrid Chinas</b>, such as <i>Charles Lawson</i>, <i>Coupe
d'H&eacute;b&eacute;</i> and <i>Madame Plantier</i>, should be grown as
bushy pillars, leaving the shoots six feet long.
Shorten the laterals on old wood to three or four
eyes. <i>Blairii No. 2</i> should hardly be touched.</p>

<p><b>Sweet Briars.</b>&mdash;Cut out all weak wood and cut
old and naked shoots down to the ground. The
Common Sweet Briar should be grown about four feet
high. The Penzance Briars make enormous base
shoots, which may be shortened to ten feet or less
according to one's requirements, and some of the
strong laterals of last year shortened back. <i>Lord</i> and
<i>Lady Penzance</i>, from their Austrian briar blood, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
much less vigorous, and need far less pruning, only
cutting out dead wood. When the Penzance and
Common Sweet Briars are grown as hedges, the base is
apt to get bare, and some of the long shoots must be
laid down to keep it clothed, while the rest are
pruned much shorter.</p>

<p><b>Hybrid Bourbons.</b>&mdash;Prune the laterals lightly,
and leave the best of the base shoots.</p>

<p><b>Hybrid Noisettes</b> and <b>Musks</b>.&mdash;Thin out old
wood and tie in young shoots.</p>

<p><b>Austrian Briars.</b>&mdash;Only cut out dead wood.
<i>Soleil d'Or</i>, a hybrid, flowers on the young wood,
and the shoots may be pruned back to two feet.</p>

<p><b>Scotch Briars.</b>&mdash;No pruning is needed, except
cutting out old and dead wood and shortening back
some of the numerous suckers.</p>

<p><b>Climbing Multifloras</b> need little pruning. When
grown as pillars or on screens they are apt to get bare
at the base. Therefore it is well to cut some of the
weaker young shoots back to two or three feet to
clothe the base, leaving the strong ones their full
length. With <i>Crimson Rambler</i> and its class, cut
out some of the old wood to make room for the young
shoots and shorten any weak laterals: but leave most
of the strong ones intact, and do not touch the long
base shoots of the last year.</p>

<p><b>Wichuraianas.</b>&mdash;Only cut out old and dead wood.
I have seen a beautiful effect produced with <i>Dorothy
Perkins</i> by cutting out <i>all</i> the old wood in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
autumn, and training the long young shoots over
wire frames two-and-a-half feet wide, forming low
arches about a yard from the ground in the centre.
The mass of flower shoots standing erect on these
frames makes a most strikingly beautiful object. The
Wichuraianas also form very lovely weeping standards
on eight-feet stems. And for tall pillars and fountain
roses they are unequalled.</p>

<p><b>Chinas.</b>&mdash;The old <i>Blush</i> and <i>Cramoisie Sup&eacute;rieure</i>
should only be thinned. The newer kinds,
such as <i>Mme. Eug&egrave;ne Resal</i>, <i><a href="#Laurette_Messimy">Laurette Messimy</a></i>, etc.,
may be cut back to a few eyes from the ground.</p>

<p><b>Bourbons.</b>&mdash;Prune lightly, growing as bold bushes
or standards; except <i>Hermosa</i>, which may be pruned
back to form a dwarf, spreading, two-feet bush; while
<i>Mrs. Bosanquet</i> is treated like the Chinas.</p>

<p><b>Noisettes</b> are of two types. The strong growers
need hardly any pruning, except <i>Mar&eacute;chal Niel</i>,
which must have all cankered and weak shoots removed
after it has flowered. <i>Lamarque</i>, <i>Fortune's
Yellow</i> (which must not be pruned at all), and <i>Jaune
Desprez</i> need a wall; and <i>C&eacute;line Forestier</i> prefers
one.</p>

<p>The other type, such as <i>L'Id&eacute;al</i> and <i><a href="#William_Allen_Richardson">William Allen
Richardson</a></i>, may be pruned fairly close, by cutting
back the laterals to a few eyes. All Noisettes bear
their flowers on the laterals; therefore these should
be preserved as much as possible.</p>

<p><b>Dijon Teas.</b>&mdash;These are the climbing and vigorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<i>Gloire de Dijon</i> and its descendants and allies, such
as <i>Belle Lyonnaise</i>, <i>Fran&ccedil;ois Crousse</i>, <i>Duchesse
d'Auerstadt</i>, <i>Mme. B&eacute;rard</i>, etc. They are all apt to
get bare below. Therefore, while some of the strong
shoots from the base are left almost their full length,
others must be cut back, some to two or three feet,
others to four or five feet, in order to keep the whole
surface of the wall, arch, or pillar clothed evenly.
The laterals may be pruned on the same plan. Old
worn out wood should be occasionally cut down to the
base to make it start afresh, when the first flowering
is over.</p>

<p><b>Banksia Roses.</b>&mdash;These need no pruning except
in the case of a very old plant, when a shoot that
shows weakness may be cut down to the base in April.
But I have pointed out in Chapter IV that the Banksias
bear their flowers on the sub-laterals of the third year.
Therefore, for three years they must not be touched
with the knife, and the shoots merely tied in evenly
over the surface of the wall.</p>

<p><b>Dwarf Polyanthas.</b>&mdash;These only need to have
the old flower stems cut out in March.</p>

<p><b>Hybrid Perpetuals</b> and <b>Hybrid Teas</b>, dwarf
and standard.&mdash;If pruned for garden purposes or what
I call enjoyment, not for exhibition, all dead wood
and weak or unripe shoots must be cut out to the
base of the plant. The centre of the plant must be
kept clear by removing shoots which cross each other.
The strong ripe shoots from the base should be cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
back to about twelve inches, and the laterals on the
old wood cut back to about four to six eyes. This is
merely a general guide to the pruning of these two
kinds of roses. But the rosarian, as I have said, will
have to study the peculiarities of each individual
plant, and to adapt these instructions to its needs,
leaving more shoots on the stronger roses, and keeping
them longer than on the weak-growing varieties.</p>

<p><b>Teas</b> and <b>Noisettes</b>, both dwarf and standard,
are pruned on exactly the same lines as the <i>Hybrid
Teas</i> and <i>Hybrid Perpetuals</i>, but must be pruned in
April instead of March.</p>

<h3>PROPAGATING ROSES.</h3>

<p>The three chief methods of propagating roses are
by&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Methods of propagating">
<tr><td align='left'>1. Budding on the briar stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2. Cuttings.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3. Layering.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><b>Budding.</b>&mdash;This is the best-known method of
propagating. And it is so widely practised by
amateurs and gardeners of all degree, that it is
better to get an object-lesson in the art than to
depend on written instructions. With a little practise
any one with neat fingers can bud. But great
care must be taken in the operation, not to bruise the
bark of the bud or "shield" that is to be inserted in
the stock.</p>

<p>The best stocks, whether for dwarfs or standards,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
are those of the wild Dog Rose from woods and
hedgerows. These should be taken up in October
and November, care being taken that each stock has
fair roots, that the roots are not torn or bruised, and
that they are not dry and shrivelled when planted.
In fact, they ought to be treated with just the same
care we bestow on our new roses when we plant them
out. The stocks may be at once shortened, to about
three feet for half-standards, and very strong ones for
specimen or weeping roses may be kept six and eight
feet long. But in shortening both, they must always
be cut just above a bud. In the following summer
these stocks will have thrown out side-shoots; and it
is in these that the buds are to be inserted. We can
tell when "the bark will run," <i>i.e.</i> that it is ready
for budding, by trying whether the thorns break off
clean when pushed by the thumb. If the thorn
bends and does not leave the bark, the wood is not
ripe enough. If the thorn sticks tight to the wood,
and yet is brittle, the wood is too ripe.</p>

<p>Dwarf stocks are treated much in the same
way, but must be planted nearer the surface than
standards; for when they are budded the earth must
be removed right down to the roots, in order to
set the bud as low as possible, as it is inserted in
the stem itself, and not in the young wood of the
year.</p>

<p>We then choose the "scion"&mdash;a twig of the rose
we wish to propagate which has already flowered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with plump but not too large buds behind each leaf
stalk. Inserting the budding-knife about half an
inch above the lowest of these buds or "eyes," we
slice down, making a little dip inwards towards the
wood as the knife passes the bud, to nearly an inch
below it, not cutting through the bark, but peeling it
off the scion. The thin slice of wood which adheres
to the inside of the strip of bark containing the bud,
is now removed by inserting the knife between it and
the bark, and jerking it out sharply. Nothing should
now be left in the bark save the soft green substance
of the "eye." But if this has been dragged out
with the wood, the bud is useless, and must be
thrown away. The shield of bark is then trimmed
to a point below.</p>

<p>The stock is now made ready to receive the bud.
At the point we have chosen for inserting the bud&mdash;in
standards let it be as close as possible to the main
stem&mdash;a perpendicular slit from half an inch to an
inch long is made with the budding-knife, care being
taken only to cut through the bark and not to wound
the wood below. A short cross-cut is made at the
top of the slit. Then the bark is gently raised on
each side downwards from this cross-cut, with the
flat handle of the knife.</p>

<p>Into this slit the bud is slipped by putting the
pointed lower end into the cross slit, and pushing it
down as far as it will go. We then cut off any bark
at the top of the bud that overlaps the cross-cut, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that the shield fits in perfectly, when the side flaps
of bark are brought gently over it.</p>

<p>With a bit of Raffia grass, well moistened in water,
we now bind up the bud; beginning from below with
a double turn over one end of the Raffia, and keeping
it quite flat, exactly in the way we put on a
surgical bandage. When we come to the bud itself,
the Raffia must be wound tightly and as close to the
eye as possible without actually touching it. When
the whole slit is completely and evenly covered, slip
the end of the Raffia through the last turn and pull
it tight. The operation is now complete.</p>

<h3>CUTTINGS.</h3>

<p>Roses on their own roots are grown from cuttings,
and it is a system which suits many varieties.</p>

<p><b>How to make a cutting.</b>&mdash;Cuttings are taken
from well-ripened twigs which have already flowered,
or from a lateral upon the main flowering shoot, which
has ceased growing without bearing a blossom. They
should be from two to six or seven inches in
length, with three to nine buds upon them. And
judgment is needed regarding these buds in choosing
the twig, as we must take one on which they are
neither immature nor too fully developed. In the case
of a cutting with ten leaves we cut off the top a
quarter of an inch above the fourth leaf, and the
same distance below the tenth. The four lower leaves
are then cut off close to the bud they cover, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
three upper ones are left on. When the cutting is
planted, two-thirds of it should be in the soil.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/ill-0049.jpg" width="302" height="500" alt="Fig. 3.&mdash;Rose cutting with a heel, 4 leaves cut, 2 leaves left." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Rose cutting with a heel, 4 leaves cut, 2 leaves left.</span>
</div>

<p>Cuttings are taken in two ways.</p>

<p>1. With a heel; that is a small portion of the
wood of the stem from which the twig grows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Without a heel; being cut through just below
a bud.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 288px;">
<img src="images/ill-0050.jpg" width="288" height="500" alt="Fig. 4.&mdash;Rose cutting without a heel, 4 leaves cut, 2 leaves left." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Rose cutting without a heel, 4 leaves cut, 2 leaves left.</span>
</div>

<p><b>Cuttings under glass.</b>&mdash;Cuttings of the choice
kinds of Teas, Hybrid Teas, Hybrid Perpetuals, and
Chinas are raised under glass, taken from pot plants
as soon as they have flowered in the spring. The
cuttings are put in pots filled with fibrous loam and
silver sand, about six in a five-inch pot. When ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to root at the end of two or three weeks, the pots are
placed in a frame on bottom heat to start growth.
The same plan is pursued in the autumn, with cuttings
taken from plants grown out of doors; but
they do not strike as rapidly as those taken from
pot plants earlier.</p>

<p><b>Cuttings in the open ground.</b>&mdash;This is an
interesting and easy way of getting a good stock of
many kinds of hardy, strong-growing Perpetuals,
Sweet Briars, Ramblers, etc. And it may be successfully
carried on from early in August to the
middle of October.</p>

<p>Cuttings are inserted three inches apart in rows,
leaving some ten inches between each row. They
may be either set in a trench, or dibbled into a
specially prepared bed. I have tried both plans, and
find the following very successful. A bit of ground,
partially but not too much shaded, is forked up; a
layer of good rotten manure laid on it; upon this
three inches of leaf mould; on this again three
inches of sharp, sandy road-scrapings&mdash;silver sand
would be as good or better, but here the gravel road-grit
is handy. The bed is then stamped down as
hard as possible, until it forms a firm solid mass.
The cuttings are then inserted in rows&mdash;a hole of the
right depth for each being made into the compost
with a smooth sharp-pointed stick the size of a lead
pencil&mdash;a long wooden penholder is a good dibble.
Into this hole the cutting is thrust till its base rests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
firmly on the bottom of the hole, and the soil is
pressed tight round the stem with the fingers. When
all are in place a thorough soaking of water is given
them; and except for firming them in when worms
raise the soil about them, they must not be disturbed
until the top leaves begin to fall. We shall then see
which are likely to strike, and can pull out those
whose wood has begun to shrivel, as they are dead.</p>

<p>Many of these cuttings will show flower the next
summer. And by November&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> fifteen months
after planting&mdash;they can be lifted and planted out
in their permanent quarters.</p>

<p>The other plan is to make a little trench eight
inches or so deep in good loamy soil, with a layer
of silver sand at the bottom. The cuttings are set
against the sloped side of the trench, and it is then
filled up with soil and stamped in very firmly. I
find this answers best for the Penzance Sweet Briars;
but personally I prefer the former plan for other
roses.</p>

<p>The cuttings must be well watered and carefully
weeded from time to time, and in the winter must
be given slight protection by fronds of bracken or
boughs of evergreens laid lightly over them.</p>

<h3>LAYERING.</h3>

<p>This is chiefly resorted to when it is wished to
increase the stock rapidly of some very choice rose.
It can be carried on in summer and early autumn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The directions given in Mr. Rivers' Rose Amateur's
Guide of 1843 are so admirable that I quote them <i>in
extenso</i>.</p>

<p>"About the middle of July in most seasons the
shoots will be found about eighteen inches or two feet
in length; from these, two-thirds of the leaves should
be cut off, close to the shoot, beginning at the base,
with a very sharp knife; the shoot must then be
brought to the ground, so as to be able to judge in
what place the hole must be made to receive it; it
may be made large enough to hold a quarter of a peck
of compost; in heavy and retentive soils this should
be rotten dung and pit sand in equal quantities, well
mixed; the shoot must then be 'tongued,' <i>i.e.</i> the
knife introduced just below a bud and brought upwards,
so as to cut about half way through; this must
be done at the side or back of the shoot (not by any
means at the front or in the bend), so that the tongue
does not close; to make this certain a small piece of
glass or thin earthenware may be introduced to keep
it open. Much nicety is required to have the tongue
at the upper part of the shoot, so as not to be in the
part which forms the bow, as it is of consequence that
it should be within two inches of the surface, so as to
feel the effects of atmospheric heat; unless this is
attended to the roots will not be emitted quickly; the
tongued part must be placed in the centre of the
compost, and a moderate-sized stone put on the
surface of the ground to keep the layer in its place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
The first week in November the layers may be taken
from the parent plant, and either potted as required,
or planted out where they are to remain. Those
shoots not long enough in July and August may be
layered in October, when the layers are taken from the
shoots, and, if any are forgotten, February and March
will be the most favourable month for the operation:
as a general rule, July is the proper season."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUMMER-FLOWERING ROSES&mdash;OLD AND NEW.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now consider those roses which, although
their lovely season of blooming is but short, shed
such fragrance and delight on the gardens of rich
and poor. Our oldest favourites first&mdash;the <a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage</a>,
sweetest of all; the <a href="#Moss_Common">Moss</a>; the Maiden's Blush; the
Crimson Damask; the Austrian, Scotch, and Sweet
Briars; the tiny <i>Rose de Meaux</i>, so seldom seen now
in England that when we find bunches of it on every
barrow in the Paris streets, to be had for a few
centimes, we fall upon it as on lost treasure.</p>

<p>Then the climbers, the Ayrshires, Banksias, Polyanthas
and Evergreen. And when to these we add all
the novelties which Japan has bestowed upon us in
the Rugosas and the Wichuraianas, and those marvels
which the hybridists are deriving from them and
introducing every year in such numbers, we may well
consider where best to make a place for these lovely
roses, so that from April till August we can rejoice
in their varied beauty.</p>

<p>Of the climbing roses I treat in a separate chapter.
But if with regard to the dwarf or bush roses, some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
may raise objections to massing them in by themselves,
because they are so soon out of flower and leave the
beds bare of bloom for the rest of the summer, the
objection&mdash;a valid one&mdash;may be overcome in two ways.
First, by planting China roses among them and an
edging of the charming Dwarf Polyantha roses round
them. Secondly, by planting lilies and late-flowering
perennials with them, which will be in bloom as soon
as they are over.</p>

<p>But to my mind, the <a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage</a>, <a href="#Moss_Common">Moss</a>, Provence and
Damask roses look most thoroughly in place in the
old-fashioned mixed border along the walk in the
kitchen garden, where they flower after wallflowers,
daffodils and polyanthus, with lilies and pinks, stocks
and carnations, and all the delightful and fragrant
odds and ends that, somehow, make it the spot in the
whole garden to which all footsteps turn instinctively.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;"><a name="CABBAGE" id="CABBAGE"></a>

CABBAGE.</div>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Provence or <a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage Rose</a></span>, <i>R. centifolia</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>is perhaps the oldest favourite in English gardens; for
it was introduced as far back as 1596. Said to have
come originally from the Caucasus, it may well be,
as its Latin and French names suggest, the Romans'
favourite "hundred-leaved-rose" mentioned by Pliny.
And as it was found in Southern France at a very
early date, it became known as the "Provence Rose."
In spite of all new comers, beautiful and attractive as
they are, the "<a href="#Apothecarys_Rose">Old Cabbage Rose</a>" holds its own
to-day in the garden of every true rose-lover, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
unsurpassed in fragrance and colour. Its pure white
variety, the <i>Rose Unique</i>, discovered in a garden in
Suffolk, in 1777, is far less common and less vigorous
than the pink <a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage</a> rose. But if it can be induced
to grow it is a very beautiful object in the summer
garden, especially as a standard on the briar. The
tiny <i>Rose de Meaux</i> and <i>Spong</i> are also miniature
Provence roses&mdash;and as I have said, ought to be more
widely grown in English gardens.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;"><a name="Moss_Common" id="Moss_Common"></a>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap"><a href="#Moss_Common">The Moss Rose</a></span>, <i>R. Muscosa</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>originally a sport from the common Provence or
<a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage rose</a>, was also introduced into England from
Holland in 1596; and many varieties have since
been derived from it, some of the newer ones having
the additional merit of being perpetual flowering.
The best are the common <i>Pink Moss</i>, <i>Comtesse
Murinais</i>, <i>Celina</i>, <i>Crested</i>, <i>Gloire des Mousseuses</i>,
<i>Laneii</i>, <i>White Bath;</i> while there is a delightful little
pink, mossed <i>Rose de Meaux</i>. Of the perpetuals,
<i>Blanche Moreau</i>, <i>Salet</i>, <i>Perpetual White Moss</i>, and
<i>Mme. Wm. Paul</i> are all good.</div>

<p>The Old Double Yellow Provence, <i>Rosa Hemisph&aelig;rica</i>
or <i>Sulphurea</i> is somewhat rare now, and
only found in one or two modern catalogues or in
very old gardens.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The French Rose</span>, <i>R. Gallica</i>, also called
<i>Rose de Provins</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>as its name implies, is a native of France; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it is also found in Italy, Switzerland and Austria.
A good deal of confusion reigns on the subject of this
rose and <i>R. Damascena;</i> for varieties of both are
often misplaced in each other's classes. For instance,
the common red <i>Gallica</i>, the "<a href="#Apothecarys_Rose">Apothecary's rose</a>," is
usually called the <i><a href="#Gallica_Red_Damask">Red Damask</a></i>, and its many striped
varieties, especially <i>Rosa Mundi</i>, are mistaken for the
true <i>York and Lancaster</i>, which is a true Damask
rose.</div>

</div>

<p><i>Rosa Gallica</i>, however, is easily distinguished from
<i>Damascena</i>. Its flowering shoots are upright, with
few prickles, and rigid leaves. It seeds very freely;
and this accounts for the innumerable varieties which
were in vogue fifty or sixty years ago. It is said that
one grower near London had two thousand different
sorts. It is still largely grown in England for distilling
purposes, on account of its delicious perfume;
and a field of the "<a href="#Apothecarys_Rose">Apothecary's rose</a>" in full flower
is a lovely sight in July. But the chief centre of the
industry used to be round Provins, the old capital of
La Brie, about sixty miles from Paris, on the way to
Ch&acirc;lons. Here vast fields were grown, the petals
being used not only for scent, but for conserves and
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>When well grown, namely well fed and well pruned
by cutting out all the weak wood and shortening back
the strong shoots to six or seven eyes, <i>Rosa gallica</i> is
worthy of a choice place as a decorative rose, whether
in the house or on the exhibition bench, when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
almost single flowers open and show their brilliant
golden stamens. The best sorts grown at present are
<i>&OElig;illet Parfait</i>, <i>Perle des Panach&eacute;es</i>, <i>Rosa Mundi</i>,
<i><a href="#Gallica_Red_Damask">Red Damask</a></i> (the all-red form of this last), <i>Village
Maid</i>, and <i>Tuscany</i>.</p>

<p>This rose was brought from Syria to Europe at the
time of the Crusades. The true <i>York and Lancaster</i>
is the best example of the old Damask rose, and grows
into a vigorous bush when well established. <i>Madame
Hardy</i>, a cross with the <a href="#CABBAGE">Cabbage rose</a>, is an excellent
pure white variety; and in the last few years some
new and admirable Damask roses, <i>Lady Curzon</i>,
<i>Lady Sarah Wilson</i>, <i>Lady White</i>, and the <i>Single
Crimson Damask</i>, have been raised by Mr. Turner;
while Mr. Orpen, of Colchester, introduced the
beautiful pink climber, <i><a href="#Mrs_O_G_Orpen">Mrs. O. G. Orpen</a></i>, in
1906.</p>

<div class='unindent'>the white rose of central Europe, introduced into
England about 1597, is now too often only to be
seen in cottagers' gardens. But surely a corner
may be found for the <i>Maiden's Blush</i>, for the fine
old <i>Blanche Belgique</i>, or for <i>Celestial</i>&mdash;the roses that
used to be seen in our childhood with a sprig of

AUSTRIAN COPPER.</div>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Austrian Briar Roses</span>, <i>R. lutea</i>.</div>

<p>These are among the most brilliant of our early
summer roses, and are distinguished also by their
singular and aromatic scent. But their flowering
season is as short as it is vivid.</p>

<p>The single Austrian Briars, mentioned by John
Gerard in 1596, both the Yellow, and the Copper
known in France as <i>Capucine</i>, should be found, if
possible, in every garden. But both are of moderate
growth; and the Copper is often troublesome to grow,
showing itself as capricious as it is attractive. For
instance, I have tried in vain for eight years to make
it flourish in my garden, while in a cottage garden by
the roadside a quarter of a mile away it flowers so
profusely that during its short-lived season of beauty
the passers-by stop to gaze at its brilliant single
blossoms of satiny-yellow lined with vivid copper red.</p>

<p>The double yellow <i>Harrisonii</i> was raised in
America in 1830; and in 1837 Willock introduced the
beautiful and fragrant <i>Persian Yellow</i>, which grows
so freely wherever it is planted.</p>

<p>All these Austrian briars have been utilized of late
by the hybridists with most interesting results. In
1900 the famous house of Pernet-Ducher, of Lyons,
succeeded in developing a new race of roses, which
they named <i>Rosa Pernetiana</i>, by crossing the
<i>Persian Yellow</i> with <i>Antoine Ducher</i>, a hybrid
perpetual. The first of these was <i>Soleil d'Or</i>, a large,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
full, flat flower, varying from gold and orange yellow
to reddish gold shaded with nasturtium red. It is
perfectly hardy, and perpetual flowering. And in
1907 they added a further seedling, far more amazing
in colour, named the <i>Lyon Rose</i>&mdash;offspring of a
cross between an unnamed seedling of <i>Soleil d'Or</i>
and the hybrid Tea <i>Mme. M&eacute;lanie Soupert</i>. This,
judging by the reports of those who have seen it,
is destined to be a most valuable addition to our
gardens.</p>

<p>Another Pernetiana, <i>Les Rosati</i>, has been raised
by Gravereaux, from a cross between <i>Persian Yellow</i>
and a hybrid Tea. It is hardy, prolific, and when I
saw it at the end of September, 1907, in MM. Soupert
et Notting's ground, it was covered with brilliant
cherry-red flowers on a yellow base&mdash;the outside of
the petals pale salmon. <i>Godfried Keller</i>, a cross
with <a href="#Austrian_Copper">Austrian Copper</a>, apricot with the outside of
the petals dark yellow, semi-double and perpetual,
and <i>Parkfeuer</i>, a shining scarlet hybrid briar, are
both of the same type.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Lord Penzance's Hybrid Sweet Briars</span>,<br />

<i>R. rubiginosa hybrida</i>.</div>

<p>These invaluable roses, the result of years of careful
hybridizing of the common Sweet Briar, <i>R. rubiginosa</i>,
with various old-fashioned roses, are amongst the
greatest gifts of last century to the rosarian, the
amateur, and the cottager.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

JEANNIE DEANS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Penzance</i>, one of the most attractive, though
less hardy and vigorous than others, resulted from a
cross with the <a href="#Austrian_Copper">Austrian Copper</a>; <i>Lord Penzance</i> from
the Austrian Yellow. This last is extraordinarily
fragrant, the scent of the leaves after rain filling the
air to a considerable distance. The rather small
flowers of both these show their parentage very clearly
in colour. But for size of blossom and effect, none of
the fourteen varieties equal the bright pink and white
<i>Flora McIvor</i>, the crimson <i>Meg Merrilies</i>, and the
superb dark crimson <i>Anne of Geirstein</i>. This last is
a plant of extraordinary vigour, forming in a few
years huge bushes ten feet high and nearly as many
through. For a high rose hedge or screen these
hybrid sweet briars are invaluable, while they may
be also used for pillars and arches. And, with the exception
of <i>Lord</i> and <i>Lady Penzance</i>, which are of more
moderate growth, they are easy to propagate, growing
readily from cuttings, which, if put in early in the
autumn are in flower the next summer. The foliage
of the common Sweet Briar, however, remains the
most fragrant of all, with a clean, wholesome
sweetness that is unsurpassed by its more showy
children, always excepting <i>Lord Penzance</i>, which, if
possible, excels it. Therefore let no one discard the
old friend, and let them plant it beside a walk, so that
they may give it a friendly pinch as they pass, to be
rewarded by its delicious scent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Scotch Briar</span>, <i>R. spinossima</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>is a most fragrant little rose, its compact bushes
forming an excellent hedge round a rose garden,
covered so closely with the sweet little double, globular
flowers that the tiny leaves are almost hidden by
the mass of blossom. They can be had in yellow,
white, or many shades of pink. But none are prettier
than the common rose-pink. The yellow is a hybrid&mdash;raised
in France early in the nineteenth century.</div>

<p>The <i><a href="#Stanwell_Perpetual">Stanwell Perpetual</a></i> is a Scotch briar, hybridized
most probably with the Damask Perpetual or
some such rose, flesh-coloured and flowering from
May till the autumn.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Rosa Rugosa, the Ramanas Rose of Japan</span>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>was introduced into England in 1784. But this fact
may, I imagine, be as great a surprise to some of my
readers as it was to myself, when I discovered the
statement on unimpeachable authority an hour ago.
I well remember the first plants of the common
pinkish-red variety, which I first saw in 1876. It
was then considered something of a novelty; and I
recollect how we all began cultivating it in our gardens,
and that we were enraptured, as were the
blackbirds and thrushes, by its large, handsome bright
scarlet fruit in the autumn.</div>

<p>The varieties in cultivation in those days were <i>alba</i>
the single white, introduced in 1784 by Thunberg, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
very lovely flower; and <i>rubra</i>, the single pinkish-red
(Cels. 1802). The hybridists began work upon these
some twenty years ago. Paul and Son brought out
<i>America</i> in 1895; and the fine <i>Atropurpurea</i> in
1900, one of the very best singles, deep glowing
crimson with brilliant golden stamens when opening at
sunrise, and turning purple later in the day. Double
hybrids were also raised, the charming white <i>Mme.
Georges Bruant</i>, 1888; <i>Blanc double de Coubert</i>,
1892; <i>Belle Poitevin</i>, 1895, rose-coloured and very
fragrant; and the handsome <i>Rose &agrave; parfum de
l'Hay</i>, 1904, carmine cerise and deliciously scented.
<i>Fimbriata</i>, 1891, semi-double, white tinted blush,
the edge of the petals fringed like a dianthus, is
perhaps the prettiest of all, and is specially suited for
growing as an isolated bush.</p>

CONRAD FERDINAND MEYER.</div>
</div>

<p>But of all the hybrids none can be compared to
the superb <i><a href="#Conrad_Ferdinand">Conrad Ferdinand Meyer</a></i> (M&uuml;ller, 1900).
This last is said to be crossed with <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>.
It certainly possesses just the same rich fragrance as
that invaluable rose, while its beautiful colour, a
warm tender pink, its large size and perfect form, its
more than vigorous growth, and its persistence in
blooming&mdash;I have it in flower here from the middle
of May till December&mdash;render it one of the most
valuable additions to the rose garden of the new
century.</p>

<p>Besides these there are numbers of other varieties,
as the continental growers, such as Bruant, Cochet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Gravereaux, Schwartz, etc., have paid considerable
attention to these roses of late years. But the future
of this race is bound to be a very important one, and
so far we have not in the least realized what its effect
may be.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CLIMBING ROSES&mdash;SUMMER FLOWERING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> are the races to which our summer gardens
owe an almost endless variety of climbing roses; and
each season adds to the bewildering number. The
older types are the Ayrshire, the Evergreen, the
Banksia, the Boursault, the Prairie rose, the Multiflora.
And twenty-one years ago, the Wichuraiana
from Japan was introduced, adding a totally new
source from whence to derive precious and beautiful
hybrids.</p>

of our hedges and woodlands, <i>Rosa arvensis</i>. In
the early years of last century many popular varieties
were developed which are still welcome in our gardens,
such as <i>Alice Gray</i>, <i>Dundee Rambler</i>, <i><a href="#Ruga">Ruga</a></i>,
<i>Queen of the Belgians</i>, <i>Splendens</i> or <i>Myrrh-scented</i>.
And in 1835, the charming little double white rose,
<i>Bennett's Seedling</i> or <i>Thoresbyana</i>, was discovered
among some briars by Lord Manvers' gardener at
Thoresby.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Evergreen Rose.</span></div>

<p>The parent of the Evergreen roses of our gardens was
the climbing wild rose of Italy, <i>Rosa Sempervirens</i>.
And the best known, and perhaps the most valuable
of these, is the white <i><a href="#Felecite_Perpetue">F&eacute;licit&eacute; et Perp&eacute;tue</a></i>, named
after the saints and martyrs Felicitas and Perpetua.
This rose and several other varieties were raised in
1827 by Monsieur Jacques, the head-gardener at the
royal gardens of Neuilly. They bloom in large clusters
of small, very full, double flowers. <i>Myrianthes
renoncule</i>, <i>Leopoldine d'Orleans</i>, and <i>Banksi&aelig;flora</i>
are white; <i>Princesse Marie</i> and <i>Flora</i> are pink, as
is <i>Williams' Evergreen</i>. As all these keep their
dark shining foliage until nearly the end of the
winter, they are very valuable on screens and
arches.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Banksian Rose</span>, <i>R. Banksia</i>.</div>

<p>This persistent foliage is one of the great merits of
the large white Banksian <i>Fortunei</i>, called in French
catalogues <i>Banks de Chine</i>&mdash;a hybrid with the
beautiful <i>Rosa Sinica</i>. Its handsome green leaves,
as I write in mid-February, are as thick outside my
window in spite of twenty degrees of frost a few
weeks back, as they were in the autumn. It will
throw shoots of immense length each year: clothing
a wall summer and winter with its rich green foliage.
It is much hardier than the Yellow and White
Banksians. The flowers, large, full, white, and sweet-scented,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
grow singly, not in clusters, and are borne
like those of the Yellow and White Banksians on the
sub-laterals&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the little flowering stems on the
laterals of last year. This habit of growth is the
reason of so many failures in getting the Banksian
roses to flower. An old plant of the Yellow Banksian
on the rectory at Strathfieldsaye had never been
known to flower when the Rev. F. Page-Roberts came
there. He, of course, discovered that it had been
pruned hard in the usual way. And after proper
attention for two years, it was last year a mass of
bloom, to the surprise of all who saw it.<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The White Banksian was introduced by Mr. William
Kerr in 1807, and named after Lady Banks. The
yellow was discovered by Dr. Abel, in 1824, growing
on the walls of Nankin. They are both natives of
China: but require a warm position on a wall in
most parts of England. The finest specimen I have
ever seen was a very old plant of the yellow, growing
some years ago inside the courtyard at Chillon. It
was one of the most beautiful objects possible in
summer, the grim walls being closely covered with
a sheet of the delicate little blossoms.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Rosa Sinica</span>, or <span class="smcap">L&aelig;vigata</span>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>mentioned above, also known as the "<i>Cherokee
Rose</i>," is a single white with yellow stamens, from
China. It is a very beautiful species; but requires,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
like the Banksians, the shelter of a wall. <i>Sinica
anemone</i> (Schmidt, 1895), silvery-pink shaded rose,
is very vigorous, and more hardy, one of the best
single climbing roses. This latter rose must not
be confused with <i>Anemon&aelig;flora</i>&mdash;a cross between
<i>Banksia</i> and <i>Multiflora</i>&mdash;with small double white
anemone-like flowers.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Boursault Roses</span>, <i>R. Alpina</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>are hardy, vigorous climbers, flowering in large clusters.
They were raised from the single red Alpine
rose. This, by the way, might be more generally
cultivated for its own sake; its smooth red stems and
handsome reddish foliage, which turns a fine colour in
autumn, and its single deep pink flowers with long
green bracts, succeeded by small brilliant hips, make
it a charming object both in summer and autumn.
M. Boursault, a famous Parisian rose amateur, gave
his name to the group, the first variety, a double
red, being called after him. <i>Amadis</i>, or <i>Crimson</i>,
is one of the oldest, a deep crimson purple; while
<i>Inermis Morletti</i>, an improved <i>Inermis</i>, was introduced
in 1883 by Morlet.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Rosa Setigera, the Bramble-Leaved or
Prairie Rose</span>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>was the parent of several useful climbers raised by
Feast, of Baltimore, and introduced into England in
1803. Of these <i>Belle of Baltimore</i> and <i>Queen of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he'">the</ins> Prairies</i> are the best, flowering late in the
summer.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Hungarian Climbing Roses</span></div>

<div class='unindent'>appear to be very little known in England. But
they are well worth growing, especially in cold
and exposed places, as they are thoroughly frost-proof.
The blossoms are large, very full, and
mostly flat in form. <i>Decoration de Geschwind</i>,
rich purple-pink with white edges, is a handsome and
effective flower. So are <i>Gilda</i>, wine colour, shaded
with violet, and <i>Ch&acirc;teau Luegg</i>, deep carmine pink.
To what family they are allied I do not know. They
were raised by Geschwind about 1886. I got them
from M. Bernaix of Lyons, and am greatly pleased
with them.</div>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Hybrids of China, Bourbon, and Noisette
Roses.</span></div>

<p>This very beautiful class of summer-flowering
climbing or pillar roses, is too often neglected in
these days. They are the result of crosses between
the Gallica, Centifolia, and Damask roses, and the
China, Noisette and Bourbon. For size, form and
colour, many of these roses are still unexcelled. And
one regrets they are not more generally grown.</p>

<p>Whether the seed parent is the perpetual China,
Bourbon, or Noisette, and the pollen parent the French
or Proven&ccedil;e rose, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, the result is that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
though it grows vigorously, the hybrid does not
flower in the autumn&mdash;with the one exception, the
beautiful <i>Gloire de Rosam&egrave;nes</i>. One of the grandest
of this class is <i>Blairii No. 2</i> (Blair 1845), blush with
rose centre, a very vigorous climber: but it should be
remembered that if pruned it will not flower. This
is also the case with the fine crimson <i>Brennus</i> or
<i>Brutus</i>. <i>Coupe d'<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Heb&eacute;'">H&eacute;b&eacute;</ins></i> and <i>Chen&eacute;dol&eacute;</i> are both good
roses; while <i>Charles Lawson</i> for a brilliant crimson
pillar rose, and the pure white <i>Madame Plantier</i> for
bush or pillar, are not easily surpassed, as their flowers
are borne in immense quantities. That very brilliant
and effective single rose, <i>Paul's Carmine Pillar</i>, is
also a hybrid; but its exact parentage is not known.
Messrs. Paul &amp; Son, of Cheshunt, write to me: "We
believe it to be, as far as we can recollect, a hybrid
with Boursault blood." This would explain its coming
into flower so early.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Climbing Multiflora or Polyantha Roses</span>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>and their hybrids, commonly known as "Rambler
roses," have developed of late years in such amazing
numbers, that it is a work of some difficulty to keep
pace with the new varieties which appear each season.
The original Multiflora, known also as <i>Polyantha
simplex</i>, was introduced from Japan in 1781 by
Thunberg. It is a very vigorous climber with large
bunches of small, single white flowers. From this
type rose, which seeds very freely, numbers of hybrids<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
were raised in Italy early in the nineteenth century,
by crossings with other richly coloured roses. One of
the earliest of these hybrids which still remains is
<i>Laure Davoust</i>, with small and very double flowers&mdash;pink
changing to blush. <i>Grevillia</i> or the <i>Seven
Sisters</i> is another, its flowers changing from crimson
to purplish rose, and then to pale rose. This produces
a most quaint effect, as we have flowers of
three colours on the plant at once. <i>De la Grifferaie</i>,
1845, is also deep rose, changing to blush.</div>

</div>
<p>It was, however, in 1893 that an extraordinary
impulse was given to the culture of these roses, by the
introduction of <i>Turner's Crimson Rambler</i>. Two
roses which are now classed among the "Ramblers"
preceded it by a few years; Allard's <i>Daniel Lacombe</i>,
1886, and the beautiful <i>Claire Jacquier</i>, 1888, raised
by Bernaix of Lyons. But the advent of <i>Crimson
Rambler</i> is really the starting point of that enthusiasm
which has reigned ever since 1893 for the
Rambler roses, and which has happily brought many
of the old varieties mentioned above into favour
once more. As many versions of the advent of this
rose are extant, I wrote to Mr. Charles Turner to ask
him its true history, and in his kind reply of February
17, 1908, he says, "The rose was brought from
Japan with other plants by an engineer on board a
trading vessel for a gentleman living near Edinburgh.
It was grown there for some time, and eventually
came into our possession."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>This rose is so well known that, like good wine, it
needs no bush of praise or description. And it was
quickly followed by other Multifloras of varying
types. In 1896 came Lambert's trio <i>Euphrosyne</i>,
the so-called Pink rambler, <i>Thalia</i>, the White rambler,
and <i>Aglaia</i>, the Yellow rambler; succeeded in 1897
by his <i>H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, pale rose with yellowish white centre.
In 1898 Dawson brought out the <i>Dawson rose</i>, with
clusters of semi-double soft-rose flowers. In 1899
came two notable additions&mdash;Paul &amp; Son's <i>Psyche;</i>
and Schmidt's <i>Leuchstern</i>&mdash;one of the most beautiful
of the race. The latter grower's invaluable <i>Rubin;</i>
Veitch's <i>Electra;</i> Paul &amp; Son's <i>Lion</i> followed in
1900; and their <i>Wallflower</i> in 1901.</p>

<p>In 1903, Wm. Paul &amp; Son brought out <i>Waltham
Rambler;</i> B. R. Cant, the exquisite <i><a href="#Blush_Rambler">Blush Rambler</a>;</i>
and Walsh of Philadelphia the <i>Philadelphia Rambler</i>.
In 1904 came Lambert's <i>Gruss an Zabern</i> and <i>Trier</i>.
In 1905 Cutbush's <i>Mrs. F. W. Flight</i>, considered by
some the Queen of ramblers. And in 1906 Weigand's
<i>Taunusbl&uuml;mchen;</i> and Soupert et Notting's beautiful
<i>Stella</i>. Last year a rich feast was provided for those
who delight in Ramblers, with Soupert et Notting's
fine new <i>Bar-le-Duc</i>, offspring of their famous tea rose
<i>Souv. de Pierre Notting</i> and <i>Crimson Rambler;</i>
Schmidt's <i>Tausendsch&ouml;n</i>, a cross between <i>Crimson
Rambler</i> and a tea-polyantha; and Wm. Paul &amp; Son's
<i>Kathleen</i>, a single flower, rich carmine-rose with a
white eye. And this year Soupert et Notting are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sending out their new <i>Bordeaux</i>, a seedling from
<i>Crimson Rambler</i> and the dwarf Polyantha <i>Blanche
Rebatel</i>.</p>


<p>Meanwhile, in 1887, the parents of a new race of
climbing roses had been brought to Europe. The
Wichuraiana (Species) was introduced from Japan
by Cr&eacute;pin, in 1887. Its small white single flowers
with their quaint hay scent, borne late in the summer,
its glossy evergreen leaves, and its vigorous creeping
habit&mdash;for it will cover a large space on a bank in
twelve months&mdash;proclaimed a new and valuable
species. And in America, Manda was quick to see
its value as the parent of a new race, by crossing it
with tea roses. Ten years later, in 1897, he brought
out <i>Manda's Triumph;</i> in 1899, the charming <i>Gardenia</i>,
<i><a href="#Jersey_Beauty">Jersey Beauty</a></i>, <i>May Queen</i>, <i>Pink Roamer</i>,
<i>South Orange Perfection</i>, <i>Universal Favourite;</i> and
in 1900, <i>Evergreen Gem</i>, one of the very best.
The next year Jackson and Perkins introduced
the incomparable <i><a href="#Dorothy_Perkins">Dorothy Perkins</a></i>. And Walsh,
another American grower, followed in 1902 with
<i>D&eacute;butante</i>, and in 1905 with <i>Hiawatha</i> and <i>Lady
Gay</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in France, M. Barbier had been
devoting himself to these charming hybrids; and
began his long list of beautiful varieties in 1900
with <i>Alb&eacute;ric Barbier</i>, <i>Ren&eacute; Andr&eacute;</i>, and the single
<i>Wichuraiana rubra;</i> to be followed by numbers of
others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

DOROTHY PERKINS.</div>
</div>
<p>One of the charms of these roses, and they have
many, is that they are to all intents and purposes
evergreen. Another is, that although they are not
perpetual, <i>i.e.</i> flowering twice in the season, the
hybrids often take after their parent the type
Wichuraiana, whose flowering season is very late&mdash;last
autumn I gathered a few flowers from it the
third week in December. Therefore, many of them
come into bloom just as the Multifloras are going
over, thus prolonging the season of summer climbing
roses till the end of August.</p>

<p>For every purpose they are of use. They may be
planted to cover an unsightly bit of bank, or to climb
over a stump, to wreath themselves into the branches
of a tree, or to form a dense covering of shining leaves
and innumerable flowers on fence or trellis or screen.
They are even more charming on pillars and arches,
when the full beauty of their blossoms can be seen
from all sides; for while many have a pendant habit,
the main flower heads, of <i><a href="#Dorothy_Perkins">Dorothy Perkins</a></i> for instance,
are carried erect above the pink foam of
the laterals that clothe the graceful hanging shoots
below.</p>

<p>A Wichuraiana hybrid&mdash;for choice the dainty
<i>rubra</i>, <i><a href="#Dorothy_Perkins">Dorothy Perkins</a></i> or <i>Hiawatha</i>&mdash;grown as a
tall, weeping standard seven feet high, is an object of
such beauty that if once seen it cannot be forgotten.
Or these charming roses may be trained round a large
balloon, in the same fashion as the <i>Crimson Rambler</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in the Royal Gardens at Windsor, figured in "The
Garden," December 30, 1905.</p>

JERSEY BEAUTY.</div>
</div>

<p>Planted on a terraced slope the Wichuraianas are
most effective. In one instance, <i>Gardenia</i>, <i>Evergreen
Gem</i>, <i>Alb&eacute;ric Barbier</i> and others were planted along
a steep grass bank below a terrace walk. A flat shelf
four feet wide had been cut half way down the bank,
and there the roses were put in some ten or twelve
feet apart. By the next summer they had joined
hands; and whether from below, or looking down on
them from the terrace above, the huge wreath with
masses of flowers among the glossy foliage made a
most exquisite display.</p>

<p>In fact there is no limit to the uses to which this
delightful family may be put. And we may believe
that there is no limit either to its future developments
in the hands of the hybridists, whose patient research
will, I have no doubt, give us before many years are
over, perpetual flowering, evergreen Wichuraianas of
every hue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CLIMBING ROSES&mdash;AUTUMN FLOWERING</div>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> many of the beautiful roses enumerated in
the last chapter are indispensable in our gardens for
covering pillars, arches, screens, walls, fences and
pergolas, an end comes all too soon to their flowering
season. And when it comes we feel the need of other
climbers to carry on the succession of blossom until
the frosts cut all off. A pergola, for instance, planted
with nothing but summer flowering roses, is but a
sorry sight in August and September. While if we
have been wise, and have made a judicious mixture
of these and perpetual roses, it remains a delight till
November.</p>

<p>For vigorous climbers of this second section none
excel</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Noisette Rose</span>, <i>R. Noisettiana</i>.</div>

<p>This invaluable race was originated by M. Philippe
Noisette in America, by fertilizing the Musk rose,
<i>R. Moschata</i>, with the Common Blush China, <i>R.
Indica</i> (not the Blush Tea rose, <i>R. Indica Odorata</i>).
In 1817 he sent the "<i>Blush Noisette</i>" to his
brother M. Louis Noisette, a well-known nurseryman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in Paris. And its advent was hailed with enthusiasm
by all rose-lovers in France; for it was recognized
as a new break in climbing roses. In this, and in
many of the seedlings which were raised from it, the
influence of its Musk rose parent was very strong,
the flowers being borne in large clusters, and fragrant
with its delicious musky scent. But as time went
on, crossings with Tea roses somewhat changed one
of the early characteristics of the Noisette, and it approached
more closely to the Tea rose&mdash;bearing flowers
singly&mdash;instead of in the large clusters characteristic
of the Musk rose.</p>

<p><i>Aim&eacute;e Vibert</i> (Vibert, 1828) is one of those early
Noisettes which holds its own everywhere. But how
seldom do we see that most vigorous and most
fragrant of all, <i>Jaune Desprez</i> (Desprez, 1828).
Grown against a west wall here, it covered a space
some 20 &times; 20 feet in three years, throwing laterals,
five feet and more long every summer; and from the
ends of these in late autumn the great heads of
bloom hang down, filling the whole air with fragrance;
in one cluster alone I have counted seventy-two
blossoms, soft sulphur, salmon, and red. This
variety, and the beautiful white <i>Lamarque</i> (Mar&eacute;chal,
1830), both need the shelter of a wall in a warm, dry
position.</p>

<p>That singularly beautiful rose <i>Fortune's Yellow</i> or
<i>Beauty of Glazenwood</i> (Fortune, 1845), which is
classed among the Noisettes, though it has nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
but its beauty in common with them&mdash;for it is not
perpetual, and its foliage is quite different from theirs&mdash;also
requires a very dry, warm situation, when, <i>if it
is never pruned</i>, it will flower abundantly. I have a
plant on a very dry border at the S.W. corner of
my house, which has scrambled up to the eaves
and is now making efforts to reach the chimneys.
The reason that this rose so often fails to bear
blossoms is, that being an untidy grower it is pruned.
And any one who has once tried to do so should be
glad to know that pruning is as fatal to the rose as
to the unhappy pruner, for it is armed with the most
cruel prickles, like small fish-hooks, of any member
of the rose tribe. The flowers, like those of the
Banksia roses, being borne on the small twigs growing
from the laterals of the second year, any pruning
which destroys these destroys all chance of blossom.
And this rule holds good with most of the
Noisettes.</p>

<p><i>Ophirie</i> (Goubault, 1841), with its rather small
nankeen and copper-red flowers and glossy leaves, is
also glad of a little shelter. While the delightful
<i>C&eacute;line Forestier</i> (Trouillard, 1842) will flourish in
almost any situation, though it prefers a wall.</p>

<p>Later on, the influence of crossings between the
Noisette and the pure Tea instead of the China rose,
is very evident in such superb roses as <i>Mar&eacute;chal
Niel</i>, <i>L'Id&eacute;al</i>, <i>Wassily Chludoff</i>&mdash;an admirable rose,
by the way&mdash;the invaluable <i>R&ecirc;ve d'Or</i>, which seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
bears a cluster of more than three flowers, and others.
But though that universal favourite, <i><a href="#William_Allen_Richardson">William Allen
Richardson</a></i>, is, alas! scentless, its habit has more
in common with the Noisettes. <i>R&ecirc;ve d'Or</i> is one of
the most useful and hardy of the race, a rampant
grower, with buff yellow blossoms borne in immense
numbers both in summer and autumn, while its rich
red shoots and reddish-green foliage make it a beautiful
object before and after it blooms. It strongly
resents any pruning beyond shortening its vigorous
summer shoots.</p>

WILLIAM ALLEN RICHARDSON.</div>
</div>

<p>Among the Hybrid Noisettes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> those crossed
with the Hybrid perpetual&mdash;<i>Boule de Neige</i>, a dwarf,
and <i>Madame Alfred Carri&egrave;re</i>, a rampant climber,
are the best. The latter is certainly one of the best
white climbing roses we have, its white blossoms,
which some liken to the porcelain roses manufactured
abroad, are borne singly on the stalks, and last long
in water, while it is never out of flower from June
to November.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Musk Rose</span>, <i>R. Moschata</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>seed parent of the Noisette, is perhaps more widely
spread than any other rose over the face of the
earth. From Madeira through Africa and Persia to
Far Cathay it blooms, and sheds its delicious musky
scent in the evening air. That it has been prized in
the West for centuries we know&mdash;for Shakespeare's
Titania promises the ass to "stick Musk roses in thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
sleek smooth head." Hakluyt says that "Of later
times was procured out of Italy the Muske rose
plant." And Bacon declares that while the white
double Violet is the sweetest of all, "next to that
is the Musk rose."</div>

<p>The original Musk rose bearing large bunches of
single white flowers, is now seldom seen except in
very old gardens where it attains a great size. Mr.
Rivers, in the <i>Amateur's Rose Guide</i>, 1843, says
that "Olivier who travelled in the first six years of
the French Republic, mentions a rose tree at Ispahan,
called the 'Chinese Rose Tree,' fifteen feet high,
formed by the union of several stems, each four or
five inches in diameter. Seeds from this tree were
sent to Paris, and produced the common Musk Rose."
But wherever it can be found it should be cherished
for the sake of its scent, which is strongest in the
evening, especially after rain, filling the whole air
with its fragrance.</p>

<p><i>Himalayica</i> is a fine single white form of Moschata;
and so is <i>Nivea</i>, a large single variety from
Nepaul, white, tinged with pink. Of the double and
semi-double hybrids, the <i>Fringed Musk</i>, a very old
favourite still in cultivation, <i>Rivers' Musk</i>, pink,
shaded buff, and the charming <i>Princesse de Nassau</i>,
straw colour and very sweet, are all good roses,
coming into flower very late in the season, and
lasting on through the autumn. For pillars they
are excellent subjects.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Madame d'Arblay</i> and <i>The Garland</i> are hybrids
of the Musk rose, which only bloom in summer.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Himalayan Briar</span>, <i>Rosa Brunonis</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>is sometimes classed with the Musk roses: but this
is an error, as it is a distinct species, and is also only
summer flowering. With its double variety, it is a
beautiful rose for pillar, arch, or pergola; the white
flowers are very sweet and borne in clusters. But it
should be planted where it can get plenty of sun to
ripen the wood.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Macartney Rose</span>, <i>R. bracteata</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>was brought from China in 1795 by Lord Macartney.
The handsome shiny evergreen foliage and large
solitary white flowers with a mass of golden stamens,
make it a beautiful object. It does best, as do its
hybrids, on a wall in a warm dry position: but it
will not flower until it is thoroughly established.
<i>Maria Leonida</i> is a hybrid of the early nineteenth
century, very beautiful when its very full white
flowers, slightly flushed in the centre with pink,
open properly. But they need plenty of sun and a
sheltered position to do so in perfection. <i>Rosa
Lucida</i> and <i>Lucida plena</i> are two rose-coloured
hybrids with handsome reddish foliage.</div>

<p>With the Noisettes, Musk, and Macartney roses,
we have only touched the fringe of autumn flowering
climbers. And three most important classes remain
to be noticed. These are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Climbing Hybrid Perpetuals, Teas, and
Hybrid Teas.</span></div>

<p>Among the Hybrid Perpetuals there are several
line climbing roses, as well as climbing sports of
well-known dwarfs, which are valuable to this class.
While roses of specially vigorous growth, but not
usually counted as climbers, such as <i>Magna Charta</i>,
<i>Margaret Dickson</i>, <i>Pierre Notting</i>, and others, make
admirable pillars.</p>

<p>But it is among the Tea and Hybrid Tea roses
that we find our richest harvest of autumn flowering
climbers. Some of these are pure climbers, such as
the noble <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> and its descendants; and
<i>Cheshunt Hybrid</i>, <i>Reine Marie Henriette</i>, <i>Reine
Olga de Wurtemberg</i>, <i>Belle Lyonnaise</i>, etc. Many
of these and others do grandly as tall standards,
making fine heads covered with bloom. And many
more can be grown as isolated bush roses, planted
out singly with plenty of space round them. <i>Gruss
an Teplitz</i>, <i>Gustave R&eacute;gis</i>, <i>Mme. Jules Gravereaux</i>,
the exquisite <i>Lady Waterlow</i>, and Cooling's <i>Apple
Blossom</i>, are specially suited to this form of growth.</p>

<p>In the following lists of these three groups of
roses, I have, for convenience sake, placed Teas and
Hybrid Teas together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='center'><br />TEA ROSES, <i>R. Indica odorata</i>.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> popular fallacy which universally prevailed
forty to fifty years ago with regard to the extreme
delicacy of Tea roses, has happily been exploded by
the experience of later years. It was then supposed
that no Tea rose could possibly stand the English
winter if planted out of doors. And so firmly was
this belief fixed in the minds of all amateurs, that if
they were so reckless (in their own eyes) as to plant a
Tea rose anywhere except in a greenhouse, the careful
treatment they bestowed on the unfortunate
specimen went far to prove the rule. For not only
was it pruned in the autumn: but so coddled and
smothered up in straw and matting that it could not
breathe; and as every bud was made doubly tender
by this means, when at last it saw the light again it
was pretty sure to die of absolute an&aelig;mia. The older
gardeners of the fifties would look in amaze on our
glorious beds of Tea roses, flowering in some cases up
to Christmas, and beginning again as happily as ever
the next June. While to us of the present day, a rose
garden without Tea roses would be no garden at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not that the modern Tea rose is hardier than
its ancestors; for some of the old ones, such as
<i>Souvenir d'un Ami</i>, grow as cheerfully in the garden
as a Hybrid Perpetual. But experience has shown
that Tea roses, with a very few exceptions, may be
safely grown in the open ground, if a few simple
precautions are observed in their treatment.</p>

<p>The first of these is, of course, that no pruning
should be done till April.</p>

<p>The second, that a few fronds of bracken should be
drawn through the branches. This in most cases will
be found quite sufficient to ward off frost. But as an
extra precaution in the event of very severe weather,
the earth may be drawn up some four or five inches
round the stems, so that if by chance a hard frost
should cut the upper part of the shoots, the base
may still be kept alive. Great care, however, must
be exercised in uncovering the plants, the protecting
material being removed gradually, so that growth may
not be unduly forced on&mdash;only to be cut by the first
cold wind&mdash;or, on the other hand, that the plant may
not receive a shock by sudden and complete exposure.</p>

<p>Standard Tea roses may be protected by straw tied
lightly round the heads, care being taken not to break
the shoots by tying them in too tightly.</p>

<p>The history of the Tea rose in Europe began just
100 years ago. The original "Blush tea-scented rose,"
<i>R. Indica odorata</i>, was brought from China in 1810.
In 1824, the "Yellow China or Tea rose" was introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from China by Mr. Parkes. And the French
growers at once began to raise seedlings from these
fruitful parents; for both in France and Italy the
Yellow Tea rose seeded freely, which was not the case
in England. By about 1830 the reputation of the
Tea rose was firmly established; and in the next
twenty years many varieties were raised: but mainly
in France, though the finest of all, <i>Devoniensis</i>, was
raised by Mr. Foster of Plymouth in 1838. The real
culture of the Tea rose by English growers, however,
did not assume much importance until a far later
period.</p>

<p>Some few of these early Tea roses still hold their
own among the host of their brilliant successors&mdash;<i>Boug&egrave;re</i>,
1832; <i>Adam</i>, 1833; <i>Le Pactole</i>&mdash;now
extremely difficult to procure; <i>Devoniensis</i>, 1838;
<i>Safrano</i>, 1839; <i>Mme. Willermoz</i>, 1843; <i>Niphetos</i>,
1844; <i>Souv. d'un Ami</i>, 1846; <i>Mme. Bravy</i>, 1846.
But of some dozen or more others in Mr. Rivers'
list of 1843, not a trace remains.</p>

<p>In 1853 a great development took place, when
Jacotot introduced an absolutely new type into the
race with his <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>. This rose is so distinct,
with its strong constitution, vigorous growth,
and large foliage, that one cannot but imagine some
other strain, such as the Noisette, must have helped
in fertilizing the seed parent of <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>.</p>

<p>Since that notable date, the raising of new Tea
roses in England, France and Luxembourg, has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
developed in an extraordinary manner. And in the
last few years Germany and America have added
many fine novelties to the bewildering list. Among
the chief growers in England who have devoted themselves
in the last fifty years to the production of Tea
roses, we find Messrs. Wm. Paul &amp; Son, of Waltham
Cross; Ben Cant, of Colchester; Paul, of Cheshunt;
Prince, of Oxford; Frank Cant, of Colchester; Alex.
Dickson, of Newtownards; Piper, Bennett, etc.</p>

<p>In France, Luxembourg and Germany, the famous
houses of Pernet-Ducher, Nabonnand, Bernaix, Bonnaire,
Cochet, Chatenay, Guillot, Verdier, Levet,
Chauvry, Dubreuil, Godard, Mari, Lacharme, L&eacute;v&ecirc;que,
Soupert et Notting, Lambert, Schwartz, etc., are now
household words among rose lovers.</p>

<p>The influence of the old Yellow Tea is to be found
among a large proportion of these lovely roses, in the
golden and sulphur base which adds such richness to
the endless shades of pink, crimson, copper and white.
But a pure yellow Tea rose is still a rarity. And its
production is the goal towards which many of the
greatest rose-growers are still working.</p>

<p>What we all desire is a Tea rose for bedding of as
pure a yellow as the dear old <i>Persian Briar</i>, or
<i>Mar&eacute;chal Niel</i>, and one that will stand, as that
glorious rose does, the hot rays of the sun without
changing colour. For, charming as many of the
so-called Yellow Tea roses are when they are in bud,
the open flower quickly turns white in the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>To this object, as I have said, some of the greatest
rose-growers have been devoting their energies for
years; while others are striving as eagerly and with
far greater success, after the development of deep
crimson and scarlet Tea roses. And though they may
not yet have attained the absolute perfection they
were seeking, both sets of experiments have resulted
of late in some truly magnificent roses, of various rich
shades undreamt of even twenty years ago.</p>

<p>In the following lists the roses will be found
grouped in colour, as this may be useful to amateurs
who are unacquainted with some of the names. Many
of those mentioned, while they are not included in
the National Rose Society's list, are still well worthy
of cultivation in our gardens; and others, hardly
known in England as yet, have proved most valuable
in my own Hampshire collection and perfectly hardy.</p>

<p>Among roses that are little known in English
gardens are <i>Baronne de Hoffmann</i>, a vigorous grower,
vivid copper-red, with yellow base; and the invaluable
<i>M. Tillier</i>, which I first saw in the Paris
Exhibition of 1900. I have grown it largely since,
and every one is attracted by the bushes, set thickly
with medium-sized imbricated flowers of carmine and
brick-red, borne on upright stems in such numbers
that they make a brilliant mark in the garden from a
distance. It is perfectly hardy, and I have gathered
good blooms at Christmas. <i>Amabilis</i> is a useful china
pink rose for decorative purposes, either in the garden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
or to cut for the house; it is strong and hardy.
So is <i>Marquise de Querhoent</i>, a strong grower, of
vivid coppery salmon and china red. Ducher's <i>Coquette
de Lyon</i> is another admirable bedding rose, which is
not much grown in England. The flowers which
cover the plant are full, well-shaped, of medium size,
a pale canary yellow, and last long in water.</p>

<p>I would also call attention to other roses which,
though well known to collectors and exhibitors, might
be more generally cultivated by the ordinary amateur.</p>

<p>These are the delightful <i>G. Nabonnand</i>, <i>Duchesse
Marie Salviati</i>, <i>Mrs. B. R. Cant</i>&mdash;an admirable rose&mdash;<i>Madame
Constant Soupert</i>, a new and most
brilliant variety; <i>Souvenir de Pierre Notting</i>&mdash;best
on a standard, but excellent in every way; <i>General
Schablikine</i>, absolutely invaluable, as it is covered
with bloom from June to November; <i>Innocent Pirola</i>,
one of the best creamy whites; <i>Peace</i>, a newer and
very beautiful rose, pale lemon, carrying its fine
flowers singly on strong erect stalks; and the older
<i>Souv. de S. A. Prince</i>, a pure white sport from <i>Souv.
d'un Ami</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Hybrid Tea-Roses</span>, <i>R. indica odorata hybrida</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all gracious gifts that the patient science of
hybridists has bestowed on rose-lovers, the development
of the Hybrid Tea is perhaps the greatest. For
here we have a rose with the substance and vigorous
constitution of the Hybrid Perpetual, one of its
parents, and the varied and delicate colours of its
other parent, the Tea rose. Whether for the garden,
to keep it brilliant with blossom from early summer
to latest autumn, or to deck the exhibition bench
with largest and most lovely blooms, the Hybrid Tea
stands unrivalled. And yet in 1867 there was but
one solitary specimen of the race in existence, and that
one was not recognized as being the forerunner of a
new family, or distinct in any way, except in its
beauty. For the noble rose <i>La France</i>, which M.
Guillot sent out in that year, was classed then, and
for many years after, as a Hybrid Perpetual.</p>

<p>It was not until 1873 that Messrs. Paul &amp; Son, of
Cheshunt, sent out the first so-called Hybrid Tea, the
<i>Cheshunt Hybrid</i>. Though in the same year Lacharme
introduced that priceless rose <i>Captain Christy:</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
but this, like <i>La France</i>, was for many years classed
with the Hybrid Perpetuals.</p>

</div>

<p>Other new roses of this new race followed slowly&mdash;very
slowly&mdash;till 1890. I have just gone carefully
through the catalogues of the chief English and
foreign rose-growers; and find that in 1889 only
twenty-four Hybrid Teas were known. There were
some truly admirable roses among them. <i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Cam&ouml;ens'">Camo&euml;ns</ins></i>
came in 1881. <i>Lady Mary Fitzwilliam</i>, one of the
most valuable, 1882. Delightful <i>Papa Gontier</i>, 1883.
<i>Grace Darling</i> and <i>Gloire Lyonnaise</i>, 1884&mdash;the latter
a rose which is not as generally cultivated as it should
be; for grown as a bush it is the perfection of an
autumn rose. <i>Viscountess Folkestone</i>, 1886. <i>Bardou
Job</i>, 1887&mdash;a slightly capricious rose in some places:
but so beautiful with its great semi-double flowers of
scarlet-crimson flaked with velvety-black, that one
bears with its little ways patiently, rejoicing when it
condescends to respond to one's care. In 1888 came
Bennett's <i>The Meteor</i>. In 1889 <i>Augustine Guinoisseau</i>,
invaluable for massing. And either that year
or the next, the gorgeous and thorny <i>Marquise de
Salisbury</i>.</p>

<p>But the real development of the race began in
1890. And since then each year has seen one superb
rose after another produced in such numbers, that it
is as difficult to keep count of them as to determine
which of the magnificent novelties should be picked
out for special mention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be noted that there has been rather too great
a tendency to raise enormous roses of slightly pale
colouring, and among them many are merely fit for
exhibition and of little use to the amateur for garden
purposes. But of late these faint shades have been
successfully fought against; and while size has been
preserved the colours are growing deeper and richer
each year. So that we are surely drawing nearer the
not impossible day when we may get Hybrid Tea
roses as brilliant a red or yellow as <i>Duke of Edinburgh</i>
or <i>Mar&eacute;chal Niel</i>, as large as <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl
Druschki</a></i>, and as fragrant, let us hope, as <i>La France</i>.
As it is, it is difficult to imagine anything much more
vivid than the orange, deep salmon-pink, copper-red,
and rosy-apricot of some of the novelties of 1906-7-8.
Among them may be noted Messrs. Alex. Dickson &amp;
Son's <i>Dorothy Page-Roberts</i>, <i>Souvenir de Stella
Gray;</i> Messrs. Wm. Paul's <i>Warrior;</i> MM. Soupert
et Notting's magnificent <i>Mme. Segond Weber</i>,
<i>Mme. J. W. Budde</i>, <i>Marichu Zayas;</i> M. Pernet-Ducher's
<i>Mme. Maurice de Luze</i>, and <i>Mrs. Aaron
Ward</i>.</p>

<p>These roses, as I have said, are the result of crossings
between the Hybrid Perpetual and the Tea rose.
And if we think for a moment how these two families
came into existence, we shall see what a curious and
interesting blending of many different strains has
been needed to develop this beautiful and valuable
race. But the end has not come yet to what may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
accomplished. And there can be no doubt that
many remarkable developments in the history of rose-growing
still lie before us and succeeding generations,
when the results of fresh experiments with the
Wichuraiana, the Rugosa, and other roses are made
known.</p>

</div>

<p>One most interesting and valuable development of
the race has already been made, and must not be
passed over in silence. I mean the single Irish roses
of Messrs. Alex. Dickson &amp; Sons, which form a little
class to themselves. These roses are most attractive,
as they are densely covered through the whole season
with flowers of varied and vivid colours, pure white,
coral pink, brilliant crimson, bronzy-scarlet, old-gold
and rose, saffron and rose. And when we add to
these beautiful shades their fragrance, their handsome
glossy foliage, their bushy growth, and their vigorous
hardy constitution, it is not surprising that since their
first appearance in 1900 they have rushed into favour,
and received many cards of commendation from the
N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.</p>

<p>With such a wealth of fine varieties to choose from,
it is a little difficult to make a selection of the very
best. But the surest guide is the judges' verdict at
recent shows for exhibition roses and those of the
decorative class, as shown in the admirable analysis
drawn up by Mr. Edward Mawley, the distinguished
honorary secretary of the National Rose Society. To
this analysis I have added a few of my own favourites,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and some of the very newest roses which have hardly
yet found their place in English shows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink and Rose Hybrid Teas.</span>&mdash;I rejoice to see

beautiful <i><a href="#Caroline_Testout">Caroline Testout</a>;</i> for this is a rose suited
to every purpose, whether for exhibition, massing in

followed by <i>La France</i>, <i>Lady Ashtown</i>, <i>Killarney</i>&mdash;but
let this be grown quite by itself, as it is one of

useful of rose colour, <i>Papa Lambert</i>, <i>Robert Scott</i>.

<p>In those remarkable shades of apricot, salmon,
coppery-pink and carmine, upon a yellow or orange
base, the choice is very considerable. And although it
is as yet almost unknown in England, having only been
sent out this spring (1908), I venture to predict a leading
position in the near future for MM. Soupert et
Notting's grand salmon-pink novelty, <i>Mme. Segond
Weber</i>, which, for shape, size, colour and delicious
fragrance is perhaps the finest rose I know. <i>Betty</i> is
one of those vivid modern roses whose colour, coppery-rose
shaded gold, is as hard to describe as it is
beautiful. While <i>Dorothy Page-Roberts</i>, <i>Souv. de
Stella Gray</i>, <i>Marquise de Sin&eacute;ty</i>, <i>Mme. Maurice
de Luze</i>, <i>Edu Meyer</i>, <i>Countess Annesley</i>, <i>Mrs.
Harvey Thomas</i>, and <i>Souv. de Maria Zozaya</i>,
are all remarkable for their strong and brilliant
colouring.</p>

<p>Among the yellow shades from palest lemon to deep
orange, the choice is not so great; but there are many
good roses to choose from, beginning with the two
novelties, of 1907&mdash;Pernet-Ducher's great Indian
yellow rose, <i>Mrs. Aaron Ward</i>, which promises well,
and Alex. Dickson &amp; Son's brilliant yellow <i>Harry
Kirk</i>. Of older roses few are better than the noble
<i><a href="#Madame_Ravary">Madame Ravary</a></i>, <i>Ferdinand Batel</i>, the delightful
<i>Gustave Regis</i>, <i>Gloire Lyonnaise</i>, <i>Duchess of Portland</i>,
and <i>Kaiserin Augusta Victoria</i>. <i>Mrs. Peter
Blair</i>, 1906, is one of the most effective yellows for
the garden; and I cannot speak too highly of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
little known but very beautiful rose <i>Peace</i>, raised by
Piper in 1903, its pale lemon yellow flowers borne on
long upright stalks are invaluable for cutting throughout
the whole season.</p>

<p>White and blush hybrid Teas are many. And the
famous <i>Bessie Brown</i>, <i>Alice Grahame</i>, <i>Mildred
Grant</i>, <i>Florence Pemberton</i>, <i>Alice Lindsell</i> and
<i>White Lady</i> are to be seen at every show: but they
are all exhibition roses except <i>Florence Pemberton</i>.</p>

<p><i>Augustine Guinoisseau</i>, however, is as good a
white garden rose as heart can desire; so is <i>Lady
Quartus Ewart;</i> and as <i>Kaiserin Augusta Victoria</i>
and <i>Peace</i> are so faintly lemon as to be nearly white,
there is no difficulty in making a bed of white Hybrid
Teas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HYBRID PERPETUALS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Rivers</span>, that father of scientific rose
culture in England, gives a most interesting account
in his famous book, <i>The Rose Amateur's Guide</i>,
1840, of the origin of the Hybrid Perpetual rose.</p>

<p>"<i>The Crimson Perpetual</i>, <i>Rose du Roi</i>, or <i>Lee's
Crimson Perpetual</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ... was raised from seed, in
1812, in the gardens of the Palace of St. Cloud, then
under the direction of Le Comte Lelieur, and named
by him Rose du Roi.... It is asserted it was
raised from the <i>Rosa Portlandica</i>, a semi-double
bright-coloured rose, much like the rose known in
this country as the <i>Scarlet Four-seasons</i> or <i>Rosa
P&aelig;stana</i>.</p>

<p>"Every gentleman's garden ought to have a
large bed of Crimson Perpetual Roses, to furnish
bouquets during August, September, and October;
their fragrance is so delightful, their colour so rich,
and their form so perfect."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>What would that great pioneer say to our Crimson
Perpetuals of to-day?</p>

<p>But though this rose was the first, and probably
the parent of many of the earlier Hybrid Perpetuals,
the true development of this glorious race took place
by other means. The Hybrid Chinas,<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> such as <i>Blairii
No. 2</i>, <i>Chen&eacute;dol&eacute;</i>, <i>Brennus</i>, and many others, now, as
I have said, most unjustly neglected, were the offspring
of the China rose, <i>R. Indica</i>, crossed with the
Provence and other hardy summer flowering roses.
These were not perpetual, with the notable exception
of <i>Gloire de Rosam&egrave;nes</i>. But several of them bore
seed freely. These fertile varieties were again crossed
with different kinds of China and Bourbon roses.
And their seed produced the new race of strong, hardy
roses, the Hybrid Perpetuals, flowering through the
whole summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Of those early parents of this fine race but very
few are known now. <i>Gloire de Rosam&egrave;nes</i> (Vibert,
1823) is still in cultivation. But in vain I search
English and French catalogues for those marked by
my father in 1844 in Mr. Rivers' book. Where
is <i>Mme. Laffay</i>, 1839, with its fine foliage and rosy-crimson,
highly fragrant flowers; or <i>Fulgorie;</i> or
<i>Rivers</i>, with its large red flowers "produced in
clusters of great beauty"; or <i>La Reine</i>, 1843; or
<i>William Jesse?</i> Probably they still exist as "old
and nameless roses" in my own and many other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
gardens. Yet one would like to give them back
the names and honourable places they possessed
in one's childhood, and compare them with their
splendid descendants. In fragrance they would
certainly hold their own; for the fragrance of their
Damask grandparent was stronger in them than
in too many of the modern Hybrid Perpetuals.</p>

<p>The great development in the race began in the
fifties, and was at its height in the sixties and
seventies: but for the last fifteen years and more
the tide has turned in favour of the Hybrid Teas;
and comparatively few new Hybrid Perpetuals are
raised each year. In 1853, Margottin gave the
enchanted rose-world <i>Jules Margottin</i>, parent of
many most excellent roses. And in the same year
the delightful <i>General Jacqueminot</i> was raised by
Roussel, and became the parent of many of our
finest deep reds. Then in 1859 came Lacharme's
famous <i>Victor Verdier</i>, a rose still in favour, and
one to which the class owes, perhaps, more than
any other as a parent. And in 1861 came <i>Charles
Lefebvre;</i> also raised by Lacharme.</p>

<p>From that date new and magnificent roses were
sent out in numbers every year by the well-known
French and Continental houses of Lacharme, Verdier,
Pernet, Gautreau, Liabaud, Guillot, Postans, Levet,
Margottin, Rambaud, Lev&ecirc;que, Jamain, Schwartz,
Soupert et Notting. And in England by Messrs.
Wm. Paul &amp; Son, B. R. Cant &amp; Sons, Bennett,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Laxton, Paul &amp; Son, Cocker, Alex. Dickson &amp; Sons,
Turner, Hugh Dickson, Cooling, Harkness, Ward, etc.
While, in 1901, Lambert produced that grandest of
white roses, <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Frau_Karl_Druschki" id="Frau_Karl_Druschki"></a>

FRAU KARL DRUSCHKI.</div>
</div>

<p>The pure pinks, and the rich crimsons and scarlets
of the Hybrid Perpetuals are of surpassing beauty.
And though there is a craze just now for Hybrid
Teas, the Hybrid Perpetual must for ever hold its
own in the garden on its own lines. For it will
flourish where the more tender race would die;
and its magnificent size, colour, strong growth, and
rich foliage, must always render it indispensable for
decoration and as a cut flower.</p>

<p>As with the Teas and Hybrid Teas, these roses
create their finest effect in the garden when grouped
together in beds of one colour. And if we wish to
specialize yet further in the matter of colours, they
may be graduated from dark to light, or light to dark,
with admirable success. A magnificent bed may be
filled with such crimsons, scarlets, and cherry reds
as the following, beginning with dark and medium
crimsons, <i>A. K. Williams</i>, <i>Duke of Edinburgh</i>,
<i>Duke of Wellington</i>, <i>Dr. Andry</i>, <i>Charles Lefebvre</i>,
<i>Countess of Oxford</i>, <i>Fisher Holmes</i>, <i>Louis Van
Houtte</i>, <i>Mrs. Harry Turner</i>, <i>Victor Hugo;</i> and
the lighter crimsons, <i>Alfred Colomb</i>, <i>Beauty of
Waltham</i>, <i>Captain Hayward</i>, <i>Duchess of Bedford</i>,
<i>Duke of Teck</i>, <i>Dupuy Jamain</i>, <i>General Jacgueminot</i>,
<i>Gloire de Margottin</i>, <i>Hugh Dickson</i>, <i>Marie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

ULRICH BRUNNER.</div>
</div>

<p>Other yet darker crimson roses, with maroon or
purple shading, are <i>Abel Carri&egrave;re</i>, <i>Black Prince</i>,
<i>Prince Camille de Rohan</i>, <i>Xavier Olibo</i>.</p>

<p>For a very effective rose-pink and carmine bed
we may use <i>Fran&ccedil;ois Michelon</i>, <i>Helen Keller</i>, <i>John
Hopper</i>, <i>Jules Margottin</i>, <i>Magna Charta</i>, <i>Marquise
de Castellane</i>, <i>Suzanne Marie Rodocanachi</i>, <i>Victor
Verdier</i>.</p>

<p>An pure pink bed is most attractive, when filled
with such lovely roses as <i>Baroness Rothschild</i>, <i>Mdlle.
Eug&eacute;nie Verdier</i>, <i>Mrs. Sharman Crawford</i>, <i>Mrs.
John Laing</i>, <i>Pride of Waltham</i>. And although
<i>Captain Christy</i> is now, wisely, called a Hybrid
Tea, it has so much the habit of the Hybrid Perpetuals,
that it really goes better in a bed with them
than among the more delicate-foliaged Teas.</p>

<p>For a white and pale blush bed we have the pure
white <i>Boule de Neige</i>, <i>Coquette des Blanches</i> (both
Dwarf Hybrid Noisettes), <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i>, and
<i>Marchioness of Londonderry</i>, which is very beautiful
when it does well, though this is not always the
case.</p>

<p>And for white with a faint blush, <i>Margaret
Dickson</i> and <i>Merveille de Lyon</i>, though these are
sadly given to mildew. But for sheer effect and
mass of bloom, a bed of <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i> is
unequalled. If the long shoots are pegged down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
every bud upon them will throw a flower-shoot,
producing a sheet of blossom throughout the whole
season.</p>

<p>Another very effective arrangement may be made
by gradating a broad border from a white centre,
through clear pinks on either side to bright scarlets,
and ending at each extremity with deepest crimsons.
This I have seen carried out successfully with a central
group of <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i>, flanked on either side
by the clear pinks of <i>Mrs. Sharman Crawford</i> and
<i>Mrs. John Laing</i>, and beyond them, right and left,
<i>General Jacqueminot</i>, <i>Fran&ccedil;ois Michelon</i>, <i>Prince
Camille de Rohan</i>, <i>Fisher Holmes</i>, <i>Duke of Edinburgh</i>,
<i>Mrs. Harry Turner</i>, <i>Dr. Andry</i>, <i>Duke of
Wellington</i>, <i>Victor Hugo</i>, <i>Captain Hayward</i>, <i>Duke
of Teck</i>, <i>Horace Vernet</i>.</p>

<p>As standards many of the Hybrid Perpetuals
make grand heads, their sturdy constitution being
particularly suitable to this form of growth.</p>

<p>Among the best for this purpose are, <i>Captain
Hayward</i>, <i>Charles Lefebvre</i>, <i>Clio</i>, <i>Dr. Andry</i>,
<i>Duke of Edinburgh</i>, <i>Dupuy Jamain</i>, <i>Ferdinand
de Lesseps</i>, <i>Fisher Holmes</i>, <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i>,
<i>General Jacqueminot</i>, <i>Gloire de Margottin</i>, <i>Heinrich
Schultheis</i>, <i>Hugh Dickson</i>, <i>Mme. Gabriel
Luizet</i>, <i>Mme. Victor Verdier</i>, <i>Margaret Dickson</i>,
<i>Marie Baumann</i>, <i>Mrs. Cocker</i>, <i>Mrs. John Laing</i>,
<i>Mrs. R. G. Sharman Crawford</i>, <i>Paul Jamain</i>,
<i>Pride of Waltham</i>, <i>Prince Arthur</i>, <i>Prince Camille<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
de Rohan</i>, <i>Senateur Vaisse</i>, <i>Suzanne Marie
Rodocanachi</i>, <i><a href="#Ulrich_Brunner">Ulrich Brunner</a></i>.</p>

<p>Besides those dwarfs I have enumerated as particularly
good for massing in colour, many other
excellent roses for general use will be found in the
following lists.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOURBON, CHINA, AND POLYANTHA ROSES</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> the three great races of perpetual flowering
Roses, the Teas, Hybrid Teas, and Hybrid Perpetuals,
on which the chief interest of the modern rose-world
is centred at the present time, there are other perpetual
flowering roses, which are of great importance
both for their value in the past and their beauty in
the present. For although the modern hybrids have
somewhat obscured the fame of their ancestors, many
of them owe their origin to the Bourbon and China
roses, which, in the early years of the nineteenth
century, before the advent of Hybrid Perpetuals, were
almost the only autumn flowering roses on which to
depend.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Bourbon Rose</span>, <i>R. Bourboniana</i>.</div>

<p>According to that invaluable book,<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to which I owe
an untold debt of gratitude since first I began to
study rose-growing seriously&mdash;the original Bourbon,
"a beautiful semi-double rose, with brilliant rose-coloured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
flowers, prominent buds, and nearly evergreen
foliage," was discovered in the Isle of Bourbon.</p>

SOUVENIR DE LA MALMAISON.</div>
</div>

<p>It appears that the land there was&mdash;probably is
still&mdash;enclosed by "hedges made of two rows of roses,
one row of the common China Rose, the other of the
Red Four Seasons, the Perpetual Damask." In
planting one of these hedges, a proprietor found a
rose quite different in appearance to the rest of his
young plants, and transferred it to his garden. Here
it flowered, and proved to be a new type, evidently a
seedling from the two sorts, which were the only
ones known in the island. "M. Br&eacute;on arrived at
Bourbon in 1817, as botanical traveller for the
Government of France, and curator of the Botanical
and Naturalization Garden there. He propagated
this rose very largely; and sent plants and seeds of
it in 1822 to Monsieur Jacques, gardener at the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chateau'">Ch&acirc;teau</ins> de Neuilly, near Paris, who distributed it
among the rose cultivators of France. M. Br&eacute;on
named it 'Rose de l'Isle Bourbon,' and is convinced
that it is a hybrid from one of the above roses, and a
native of the island."</p>

<p>The true Bourbon roses are thoroughly perpetual,
with rose, blush, or white flowers, smooth solid stems,
and dark, almost evergreen, foliage. One has only to
mention the well-known and well-beloved <i><a href="#Souvenir_de_la_Malmaison">Souvenir
de la Malmaison</a></i> to recall the type. <i>Gloire de
Rosam&egrave;nes</i><a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is a hybrid, as I have said: but <i>Hermosa</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or <i>Armosa</i> (1840), and the charming <i>Mrs. Bosanquet</i>
(1832), often classed among the China roses, are pure
Bourbons, and so are <i>Mme. Isaac Pereire</i>, <i>Mrs. Paul</i>
(1891), <i>Queen of the Bourbons</i>, <i>Boule de Neige</i>,
<i>Setina</i> a climbing form of <i>Hermosa</i>, and <i>Zephirine
Drouhin</i> (1873), a good climbing rose. <i>Hermosa</i>,
which is constantly mistaken for a very full, globular
pink China, is an excellent rose for massing in the
garden, as it is in continuous bloom from spring till
late autumn, the dwarf, bushy plants being covered
with flowers. The charming hybrid Tea rose, <i>Camo&euml;ns</i>,
which resembles it in habit, but is a rather larger
flower of a rich China pink, may also be used in the
same way. A group of small beds arranged in a
simple geometrical pattern, and planted with either
or both these roses, is an extremely pretty feature in
the garden. <i>Hermosa</i> has been for years largely used
in this way on the Continent and in England; for
instance, 20,000 have been planted in the Sandringham
gardens alone. But I was told last year in
Luxembourg, that in Holland, where it is most
popular, <i>Camo&euml;ns</i> is almost superseding it; one
Dutch lady who had a large portion of her garden
planted with nothing but <i>Hermosa</i>, is now using
hundreds of <i>Camo&euml;ns</i> in the same way, as it is
equally generous in bloom, richer in colour, and as
neat and strong in growth.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The China Rose</span>, <i>R. Indica</i>.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Crimson China Rose</span>, <i>R. Semperflorens</i>.</div>

<p>These old favourites were introduced into England
in the eighteenth century. The <i>Old Blush Monthly</i>
came first, in 1718; and in 1789 the <i>Old Crimson</i>
(<i>R. Semperflorens</i>), a much less vigorous plant,
arrived. It is not surprising that both should have
found instant popularity; for roses which in warm
situations are practically in flower the whole year
through, must indeed have been precious adjuncts
to the gardens of those days. In England they were
popularly known as "Monthly roses"; while in France
they are known as <i>Rosiers du Bengal</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The "Common" China, or Monthly Rose</span> (1796),</div>

<div class='unindent'>though it has many newer rivals, is one of those which
has never gone out of favour, and justly so; for what
can be more pure and lovely than it is when well
grown. Either as a bedder, or a bush in the herbaceous
border, or, still more, when grown as a dwarf hedge,
its fresh loveliness is a never-ending delight. Indeed,
one wonders why it is not more generally used in
England in this last manner; for both in the South
of France and Switzerland, hedges of the pink Monthly
rose are common, and of exceeding beauty. <i>Cramoisie
Sup&eacute;rieure</i> (1834), a form of the Crimson China, should
be grown in masses, as its weak and straggling growth
is unsuited to the above purposes. But many of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
newer varieties are admirable in whatever way they
are used. <i><a href="#Laurette_Messimy">Laurette Messimy</a></i> (1887), rose, shaded
yellow, and <i>Madame Eug&egrave;ne Resal</i> (1895), copper
and bright China-rose, are two of the very best of these,
and are brilliantly effective as bedding roses. So are the
rosy-apricot <i>Queen Mab</i> (1906), and the yellow-apricot
and orange <i>Arethusa</i> (1903). <i>Comtesse du Cayla</i>
(1902) is a fine carmine crimson, with orange on the
outer petals, varying to orange-yellow shaded carmine.
<i>Cora</i> is a pretty clear yellow, often tinted carmine, a
rose of a charming habit. <i>Le Vesuve</i> bears some
flowers rich crimson and some rosy pink. <i>Ducher</i>
(1869) is the best white; <i>Frau Syndica R&oelig;loffs</i>,
yellow, shaded coppery-red and peach; <i>Nabonnand</i>,
a large flower, velvety purple-red, shaded coppery-yellow.
<i>Souvenir d'Aim&eacute;e Terrel des Ch&ecirc;nes</i> is a
small, beautiful, and well-shaped flower, coppery-pink,
shaded carmine, the pointed buds being golden
yellow. <i>Climbing Cramoisie Sup&eacute;rieure</i> and <i>Field

<p>We now come to a quite modern class of perpetual
flowering roses, which is as yet too little known,
except among those ardent rose-growers who keep
closely in touch with the marvels of modern hybridization.
And this special race is indeed one of its
most extraordinary results. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">The Dwarf Polyantha Roses</span>, <i>R. Multiflora</i>,</div>

<div class='unindent'>are derived from the summer flowering, climbing
<i>Multiflora</i>, and in them we get a first cousin of, say,
<i>Crimson Rambler</i>, so dwarf as to make a charming
two-feet high edging to an ordinary rose-bed, and
so thoroughly perpetual, that from May to December
it is thickly covered with its hundreds of miniature
flowers in clusters. How these tiny roses, which
remind one of the "Fairy Rose" of long-ago nursery
days, came into being is not exactly known. But
they were evidently the result of crossings with the
Tea rose strain. M. J. B. Guillot developed the
first, <i>Ma Paquerrette</i>, pure white, flowering in large
bunches, in 1875. In 1879, Rambaux followed with
the charming <i>Anna Maria de Montravel</i>, one of the
best known of the class. The next year Ducher
brought out the lovely <i>Cecile Brunner</i>, blush, shaded
pink, and the race was fully recognized. Since then
nearly every year has seen fresh varieties; and the
charming little plants are growing in favour.</div>

<p>These roses may be roughly divided into two
classes: one showing the Polyantha blood very
strongly; the other the Tea blood.</p>

<p>In the first, the flowers, whether double or single,
are borne in dense upright clusters, after the manner
of the true <i>Multiflora</i>. Some of the best of these
are <i>Gloire des Polyantha;</i> <i>Schneewittchen;</i> the fine
<i>Mme. N. Levavasseur</i>, really a miniature <i>Crimson</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
<i>Rambler;</i> the even more attractive <i>Mrs. W. H.
Cutbush</i>, a bright pink <i>Crimson Rambler;</i> and
the exquisite little <i>Baby Dorothy</i>, which has created
such a sensation as a pot plant since it was shown
in the spring of 1907. These are all admirably
fitted for planting in masses. In the famous P&eacute;pini&egrave;re,
or Public Gardens of Nancy, beds of <i>Madame N.
Levavasseur</i> last autumn (1907) were remarkably
effective. In one the ground was thickly covered
among the plants with a very dwarf grey-blue
Ageratum; and the effect of the erect crimson
clusters of the rose over the soft grey flowers
was most striking; while another bed of the same
rose was edged with a dwarf bronze-foliaged fibrous
Begonia. Even more charming was a whole bed of
<i>Mrs. W. H. Cutbush</i>, which I saw in MM. Soupert et
Notting's garden at Luxembourg, the rich rosy colour
being much finer.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;"><a name="Perle_DOr" id="Perle_DOr"></a>
<img src="images/ill-0208.jpg" width="436" height="500" alt="Dwarf Polyantha. PERLE D&#39;OR." title="" />
<div class="caption2"><span style="margin-right: 3em;">Dwarf Polyantha.</span><br />
PERLE D&#39;OR.</div>
</div>

<p>In the other class the Tea blood is shown as
strongly; the flowers are borne singly, or at most in
heads of four or five, on smooth and delicate yet firm
little stalks; while the foliage is that of a miniature
Tea rose. These as to the actual blossoms are perhaps
even more attractive. For what can be prettier
than a perfectly formed flower the size of a Fairy
rose&mdash;and sweetly scented too&mdash;such as those of
<i>&Eacute;toile d'Or</i>, lemon shaded with sulphur; or <i><a href="#Perle_DOr">Perle
d'Or</a></i>, nankeen yellow with orange centre; or <i>Eug&eacute;nie
Lamesch</i>, coppery pink; or the beautiful <i>Cecile</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
<i>Brunner</i>, its well-shaped flowers blush with a deeper
pink centre?</p>

<p>In one or two we get an example of the double
strain. For the velvety crimson flowers of <i>Perle
des Rouges</i> are borne in clusters, though in substance
and foliage the plant appears to take after the Tea rose.</p>

<p>But I deprecate the tendency which I see among
some varieties, to produce much larger flowers such
as those of <i>Clothilde Soupert</i> and <i>Georges Pernet</i>.
This quite alters the character of the pretty little
plants; giving us a rose that is neither one thing or
another, neither a fine bedding rose or a miniature
edging rose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ROSE PESTS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> enemies of the rose are many. They are of
two classes; the insect foes, and diseases caused by
Fungi. And their prevention and destruction are
tasks, as every rose-grower knows only too well, which
call for ceaseless vigilance and constant work, more
especially in the early months of the season. For
if remedies are applied in good time, the pests of
both kinds give comparatively little trouble after
May and June until the early autumn, when a fresh
crop of both appears.</p>

<p>No such powerful weapon has ever before been put
in the hand of the rose-grower, as the remarkable
handbook on the <i>Enemies of the Rose</i>, published this
spring (1908) by the National Rose Society. For
here the veriest tyro can recognize the diseases which
puzzle him and the insects which drive him to
despair in all stages of their mischievous existence,
figured in exquisitely drawn and coloured plates;
while in the terse and admirable letter-press he is
told how to combat their destructive ways. This
little book can be obtained by non-members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Society for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, through any member; and it
ought to find a place on the shelf of every rose
lover.</p>

<p><b>Mildew</b>, of all Fungoid diseases, is the worst we
have to contend with. Some roses, such as the lovely
<i>H. T. Killarney</i>, the <i>Crimson Rambler</i>, the <i>H. P.
Margaret Dickson</i>, and others, are specially subject
to this pest; and unless measures are taken against
it when the very first sign appears, it quickly spreads
to other roses. Two seasons ago a plant of <i>Margaret
Dickson</i> had it badly in my garden, and infected
its neighbour, <i><a href="#Frau_Karl_Druschki">Frau Karl Druschki</a></i>, to an alarming
extent.</p>

<p>This odious disease, though more or less always
present in the garden, appears generally in marked
strength twice in the season&mdash;first in spring, when
the foliage is just fully developed, and secondly
after the midsummer shoots are grown.</p>

<p>It must be attacked early before it gets any hold,
in fact, before it actually shows, if we have reason to
suspect its presence. <i>Flowers of Sulphur</i> is the
most usual and effective preventive. It is blown
over the plants with bellows made specially for the
purpose. Floating like a fine cloud all over the
garden it settles on every part of the plant. The
early morning before the dew is gone is the time to
apply it, as the evaporation of the dew has some
subtle effect on the sulphur which greatly increases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
its efficacy. Rev. F. Page-Roberts strongly recommends
<i>Black Sulphur</i> instead of the ordinary yellow,
used with one of the "Ideal" Powder Bellows, made
by W. Wood &amp; Son, Wood Green.</p>

<p>Another preventive, which is advised in the
National Rose Society's handbook as extremely
efficacious, is syringing with <i>Potassium Sulphide</i>,
<i>Liver of Sulphur</i>&mdash;half an ounce to a gallon of
water. The handbook advises adding a tablespoonful
of liquid glue, or the whites of two eggs to every
gallon of water, as this causes the solution to adhere
better to the foliage. If thoroughly and carefully
applied with a very fine syringe, such as the Abol
Syringe, using the bend attached to get at the under-side
of the leaves where the fungus first appears, this
wash acts rapidly upon the pests.</p>

<p><i>Mo-Effic</i>, a new preparation, has been highly
recommended in the last two years. I have not
tested it myself. But Mr. Mawley considers it most
successful.</p>

<p><b>Black Spot</b> is another troublesome pest. It attacks
the foliage alone, and not only spoils the appearance
of the leaves, but so injures them that they fall off
prematurely. The disease can be best checked by
spraying with the <i>Liver of Sulphur</i> wash, beginning
early in the spring and going on at intervals.</p>

<p><b>Rose Rust</b> and <b>Rose Leaf Scorch</b> may also be
combated with <i>Liver of Sulphur</i> wash.</p>

<p>But in all these three last diseases, it is a matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the greatest importance to collect the badly diseased
leaves on the plant, and especially to pick up every
one lying on the ground, and to see that they are burnt
at once and not thrown on the rubbish heap, where
they will only infect the soil.</p>

<p><b>Sooty Mould</b>, the unsightly black stuff which
often covers the foliage, is a parasitic fungus not upon
the leaf itself but upon the "honey dew" deposited
by Green Fly. If therefore the honey dew is kept off
by destroying the Aphides which secrete it, <i>Sooty
Mould</i> will not appear.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Insect Pests.</span></div>

<p><b>Green Fly</b>, or <b>Rose Aphis</b>, is alas! too well
known in every garden to need much description.
But the reason why it is so difficult sometimes to
get rid of this pest is not so commonly known. The
Aphides breathe through pores at the sides of their
bodies. And in order to kill them, some substance
must be used which will close these pores. Therefore
syringing with water or any clear liquid is absolutely
useless; for if a few Green Fly are knocked off one
shoot they will only settle on some other. We often
hear people say after a thunderstorm, "This will
clean the roses and wash off the Green Fly nicely."
Far from it. They only increase the faster; while
the caterpillars rejoice, and flaunt themselves openly
on every bush. Then in despair some one uses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
paraffin or some violently caustic wash for spraying
the Green Fly, and destroys his roses thereby.</p>

<p>Nature has mercifully provided some enemies to
prey on the Green Fly&mdash;and these help in some small
degree to keep the pest down. The chief of these
is the Ladybird, which both in its adult and in its
larval state devours them ceaselessly. The pretty
green Lace-wing Fly or Aphis Lion is also useful, as
its larv&aelig; are provided with "large sickle-shaped jaws
for picking the Green Fly off the plants."</p>

<p>The Hover Fly&mdash;which looks like a small, slim
two-winged bee or wasp&mdash;lays its eggs in the thick
of a mass of Green Fly, and its green and grey leech-like
maggots feed upon them. And the Ichneumon
and Chalcid Flies lay their eggs in the bodies of the
Aphides and their maggots feed on them from within.</p>

<p>But all these are of comparatively little help to
the unhappy rosarian, who must therefore devise
unnatural means to clear his plants.</p>

<p>As far as I know, with the exception of an Aphis
brush&mdash;a useful invention, but one which needs very
gentle handling&mdash;there are only two safe remedies
for this universal plague. The usual one is a wash
of soft-soap and quassia, in these proportions&mdash;</p>

<p>Even this wash, excellent as it is, will sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fail to get rid of the scourge in a bad year. But
I have found "Abol, White's Superior," a never-failing
remedy. It is also much easier to use, as
one only has to mix it with cold water according to
the directions on each can, and it is ready in a
minute.</p>

<p>If either of these remedies are used the moment
the Green Fly appears, and the dose repeated a couple
of days later in order to kill any that may have
escaped the first spraying, we have very little more
trouble until the second crop of Green Fly appears in
September. It is well to syringe the plants thoroughly
with pure water a few days after the second dose
of either of these washes, as this knocks off the
dead Aphides, and leaves the foliage clean and
sweet.</p>

<p>Although paraffin in various forms is often recommended,
let me urge upon my readers that it is a
most dangerous substance to use upon the rose&mdash;a
naturally delicate plant&mdash;as any remedy of a caustic
nature is sure to do it far more harm than good.</p>

<p>Tobacco wash is recommended by the Continental
rose-growers for Aphis, 1 part of tobacco-juice to
15 parts of water. If a little soft-soap is added it
makes a better wash. This is also a good wash for</p>

<p><b>Cuckoo Spit</b> or <b>Frog-Fly</b>.&mdash;This frothy substance
if washed off will be found to contain a yellow
creature, often closely wedged into the angle of leaf
and shoot, or at the base of a flower bud. This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a "nymph" or young Frog-Fly&mdash;a most destructive
insect&mdash;and unless removed it will so quickly suck
the sap of the leaf and bud that it dies and falls off.</p>

<p>To get rid of them requires patience. We must
either hand-pick the roses&mdash;or if we spray with the
tobacco wash it is necessary to syringe the plant with
plain water first, using some force, to wash off the
white froth&mdash;and then spray with the tobacco wash
to kill the "nymph."</p>

<p>This leads us to the more active and the worst of
all the pests we have to fight against.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Beetles, Bees, Flies, and Moths,</span></div>

<div class='unindent'>which either in their adult form or as maggots and
caterpillars prey upon the rose.</div>

<p>Four Beetles are among the enemies of the rose.
The beautiful green <b>Rose Beetle</b> or <b>Rose Chafer</b>
does harm in both stages. As a grub it feeds underground
on the roots; and as a beetle eats the foliage
and the petals and anthers of the flowers. I find it
is particularly fond of the delicate blossoms of the
<i>Yellow Persian Briar</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Cock Chafer</b> also eats the foliage, and its
large white grubs devour the roots of the roses to
such an extent that they often kill the plant. As the
grubs remain for three years in the ground the
damage they can do is incalculable; and they attack
other plants besides roses. Among the roots of a
herbaceous Spir&aelig;a I lifted this last winter, I caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
forty of these grubs, and found they had so honey-combed
the roots that the plant had to be burnt.</p>

<p>The <b>Summer Chafer</b> and <b>Garden Chafer</b> also
attack roses.</p>

<p>Where these four chafers are prevalent there is no
cure but hand-picking. The beetles must be collected
off the bushes; and the grubs carefully picked out of
the roots, if we have reason to think they are present
from the rose appearing unhealthy. Or they may be
tempted out of the soil by placing grass turves
upside down close to the plants, when they can
be picked out and killed with a little boiling
water.</p>

<p>The <b>Rose Leaf-cutting Bee</b> spoils the foliage by
cutting semi-circular pieces out of the leaves to line its
nest. A few years ago I found that a fine young
plant of <i>Tea Rambler</i> was so relished by this bee
that hardly a leaf was left intact. There is no cure
but to watch the bee going into her nest and there to
destroy it after dusk.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of all pests that the rose-grower has to fight against</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Caterpillars and Maggots</span></div>

<div class='unindent'>are the very worst. For there is no real remedy
against their endless and varied depredations save
hand-picking; or as some one has tersely put it,
"just a little gentle washing with non-caustic substances,
and just a lot of finger-and-thumb work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
This is tedious, and often disgusting; but it is the
only way.</div>

<p>These loathsome pests are the larv&aelig; of certain flies
and many kinds of moths.</p>

<p><b>Sawflies</b>, the little black and shiny flies which
infest the roses in May and June, are a terrible pest,
as the eggs they lay on the leaves turn quickly into
small, green larv&aelig;. There are several kinds of sawflies,
and their destructive methods vary. The Leaf-rolling
Sawfly, whose larv&aelig; roll the rose-leaves like
paper spills, has become a serious pest among garden
roses of late years, and if these rolls are carefully unfolded
the little green maggot will be found in one
of them. It must be caught with care, as it is very
lively, and if allowed to fall to the ground will remain
there, and produce a fresh brood in the next year.</p>

<p>The <b>Rose Slugworm</b> is much more common,
and most destructive, eating the upper surface of the
leaves and leaving the lower to shrivel up. It has
two broods in the year.</p>

<p>The <b>Rose Emphytus</b> is another of the sawflies,
and one of the worst. Its larva eats the whole leaf
away, beginning at the mid rib, and also works its way
into a cell in the branches till the next spring, thus
killing the tender growths above. This is the green
caterpillar which we find coiled up on the under-side
of the rose-leaves, or in early morning and late evening
curled round the base of a rose-bud, working its
way through the calyx into the heart of the flower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
It is far easier to catch, as it is somewhat sluggish
in movement, clean and hard in substance&mdash;and
therefore less disgusting to touch than others that
squash in one's fingers. The best remedies for these
pests are: first, prevention, by spraying with hellebore
wash, which I have found most useful. Second, by
careful hand-picking when the larv&aelig; appear. And
third, by removing the surface soil in which the
cocoons are buried, and all dead wood, during the
winter.</p>

<p>Hellebore wash is made in the following proportion&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Hellebore wash">
<tr><td align='left'>1 oz. fresh-ground hellebore powder.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>2 oz. flour.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3 gallons of water.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Mix the hellebore and flour with a little water till
dissolved; then stir into the rest of the water and
apply with a fine Abol Syringe.</p>

<p><b>Caterpillars</b> of many moths are among the most
deadly foes of the rose. Some eat the foliage&mdash;such
as the Buff Tip and Vapourer Moths; others tunnel
into the leaves. But the worst of all are the Tortrix
Moths or Rose Maggots, whose repulsive grubs eat the
unopened blossoms and spin the delicate young leaves
together, destroying the whole top of the new shoots.
There are many varieties of Tortrix, which are all
quite small moths, and their caterpillars or "Maggots"
are the most unpleasant and destructive of all we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have to deal with. The worst of all are the Red and
the Brown Rose Maggots. These creatures are dirty
red or brown, with black heads; they are soft, and
grow very fat, and when full grown are half an inch
long. They spin the leaves together at the top of
the tender young flowering shoots, often bending the
top down; and not only eat the leaves in the midst
of this filthy fortress, but eat their way into the buds
and destroy them.</p>

<p>Other Tortrix Moths have green and yellow-green
maggots. The worst is the Green Rose Maggot&mdash;bluish-green
with a black head. It also spins the
leaves together, and grows nearly as large as the brown.
It is extremely active, and very soft and slimy.</p>

<p>These all turn to pup&aelig; among the leaves instead
of in the soil; and any left in the foliage must be
picked out and burnt. If we wait until the shoots
and buds are eaten and the foliage spoilt&mdash;nay, till
often the whole of our early flowers are ruined&mdash;the
only remedy is to pinch the leaves which conceal the
maggot, if we have courage to do so, or to hand-pick
every one we see. But happily a way exists of preventing
these loathsome pests from destroying our
roses. And this is to spray the plants from the middle
of April to early in May with <i>arsenate of lead</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
This should be done twice, and will prevent many other
caterpillars from feeding on the foliage.</p>

<p><b>The Vapourer Moth</b>, the little golden brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
moth with a tiny white crescent on each wing, is
unfortunately common everywhere, in town as well
as country; and its caterpillars are as destructive as
they are beautiful. These caterpillars are found in
great masses upon the hawthorn and fruit trees, and
attack the rose as well. They are handsome, hairy
creatures, spotted thickly with bright pink-red tubercles,
with four erect tufts of yellow hairs on the back,
and five longer tufts of darker hairs, two pointing forwards,
one backwards over the tail, and two at the
sides.</p>

<p>If there are too many to be hand-picked the bushes
must be sprayed with <i>arsenate of lead</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Buff Tip Moth</b> does most harm in the
autumn, when its caterpillars, yellow and green, with
longitudinal black lines divided by yellow bands,
appear in colonies, feeding upon the surface of the
leaves. They should be picked off at once, before
they grow large, as they reach a length of two inches
when full grown, and disperse, feeding singly. If
very plentiful, spraying with <i>arsenate of lead</i> will
destroy them.</p>

<p><b>The Winter Moth</b>, which is such a serious pest
among fruit trees, also attacks roses. The caterpillar
is hatched very early, in the end of March and beginning
of April. It is a "Looper," greyish at first and
turning green later, and nearly an inch long when
full grown.</p>

<p>The grease bands we use on fruit trees to catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the wingless female as she creeps up in the autumn
to lay her eggs on the bark, would be difficult to use
for rose-bushes. The only plan therefore is to
spray very early in the season with <i>arsenate of lead</i>
wash.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Another "Looper" found early on the roses is that
of the <b>Mottled Umber Moth</b>. It is brown with
yellowish sides, looks almost like a twig, and is over
an inch long. It must be hand-picked.</p>

<p>The <b>Dagger Moth's</b> caterpillar&mdash;a long, grey-black
creature with a yellow line along the back, a large
black hump on the shoulder and a small one at the tail,
is most destructive when it appears in late summer and
early autumn. It is generally found singly; but one
specimen will strip a whole shoot of leaves, leaving
only the mid rib. Hand-picking is the only remedy.</p>

<p>These are the chief of the pests which we have to
fight against. And if we desire to keep our roses in
health and beauty we must remember that prevention
is better than cure, and begin our treatment in good
time, before the many enemies of the rose get too firm
a hold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW TO GROW ROSES FOR EXHIBITION</div>

<div class='center'>(<i>By the</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. F. Page-Roberts</span>, <i>Vice-President National Rose
Society</i>, <i>F.R.H.S.</i>)</div>



<p><span class="smcap">In</span> writing this chapter my purpose is to tell, in
a few clear words, the way to grow fine roses, whether
they be for exhibition or for private delight; for the
method and culture are identical, if the blooms are to
be worth looking at.</p>

<p>First, then, as to situation and soil. If possible,
choose a position for the beds sheltered from strong
winds, yet not near large trees, or hedges; for the
roots will enter the beds and rob them of moisture
and nutriment. Buildings and walls are the best
shelters.</p>

<p>Make the beds, if possible, in the highest part of the
garden, and not the lowest; roses like an open situation,
though they need shelter from strong winds,
and shade, if possible, from the midday sun. In writing
these notes I do not wish to say anything that
will discourage any one from trying to grow exhibition
roses; for they can be grown, more or less well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in almost any situation, and any soil. Those who
can choose both are to be envied.</p>

<p>Then as to soil; some varieties, the H.&nbsp;Ps., will
only give the finest blooms in heavy loam; the H.
Teas in a less heavy; and the Teas, the most beautiful,
though perhaps not so popular as the dark H.&nbsp;Ps.,
in quite light sandy soil. So the grower must decide
according to his situation and soil what varieties to
grow, remembering that the Teas are liable to suffer
from severe frost.</p>

<p>I make my beds three feet deep and three feet
wide,<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> allowing for two rows of roses, and a grass
path about thirty inches wide between the beds, grass
being more sightly than gravel, and pleasanter to walk
on. The beds, if the soil is heavy, will be all the
better for being raised a little above the level of the
paths; the roots do not like stagnant water. The
beds should be prepared in the autumn, a few weeks
before the end of October, that the soil may settle.
The manure should be below the roots, not touching
them; the roots will find it, and it is better for them
to go down, than to come to the surface and suffer if
the season be dry. A good sprinkling of bone meal
spread over the top soil before planting (with a dusting
of basic slag, three to four ounces per square yard)
will be all that is necessary at this time. Covering
the beds with manure in the winter is not recommended;
and digging, or even turning it in, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
spring, is not advisable, however carefully it is done,
as some of the roots must suffer, and, besides, manure
does not protect the roots. The beds should never
be disturbed more than the depth that a hoe will do
it. The beds for H.&nbsp;Ts. and Teas should be prepared
in the same way. Beds wide enough for two rows
are more easily managed than wider ones, there being
no need to tread on the soil when attending to the
plants, and they can be more easily hoed.</p>

<p>When selecting varieties, consult an expert, or
better still, if you are not a subscriber to the N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.
(and this all rosarians should be), get a copy of the
N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S. official catalogue of Roses, which can be obtained
by non-members through a member, price
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This will give you all the information desired.
A list of good roses for exhibition is given at the
end of this chapter. It is advisable to order the
plants early, as nurserymen execute orders in the
order in which they are received, and planting should
be done during the end of October and November;
if not done then it must be deferred till February or
March.</p>

<p>The distance of plants from each other depends a
good deal upon the varieties. Strong growers should
be planted wider apart than small growers; one foot
apart is about the usual distance in the rows.</p>

<p>There are some varieties like <i>A. K. Williams</i>,
<i>Mrs. W. J. Grant</i>, and <i>Horace Vernet</i>, that do not
transplant well. These ought to be budded, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
moved, if possible. Dwarf-rooted stocks can be bought
of the nurserymen at a small cost; and the Standard
stocks, the best for Tea roses, can be usually got in
the neighbouring hedges.</p>

<p><b>Pruning.</b><a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;The object of pruning is to give increased
vigour to the plant, and to keep it within
bounds; to make, if possible, a new plant each year,
a new top to the old roots. And to do this, severe
pruning is absolutely necessary. The harder the
pruning, the stronger the growth. Each variety
should be pruned according to its growth. If very
vigorous, they require less cutting back than those
of moderate, or weakly growth.</p>

<p>H.&nbsp;Ps. will be pruned harder than either H.&nbsp;Ts. or
Teas; the latter, on account of frost, will sometimes
do with little pruning beyond cutting out all dead
and weakly shoots, and shortening slightly the long
straggling ones. In all cases do not allow the centre
of the plant to be crowded. The H.&nbsp;Ps. as a rule,
may be cut down to two or three eyes, leaving the
very vigorous shoots of some kinds even five or six
eyes; but all weak shoots must be cut down to the
base of the plant. This pruning should be done in
March, leaving the Teas till April. If in pruning
the pith be found to be dark in colour, the shoot
must be cut back. Sometimes it will be necessary to
cut it quite away, if no light-coloured pith can be
seen. Then a certain amount of pruning or thinning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of the shoots is necessary in the spring, after the
roses have started growing; three to six shoots only,
according to the variety, should be left. A thinning
again in autumn, of the shoots that have done their
work, will give the later shoots a better chance of
ripening.</p>

<p><b>Manuring.</b>&mdash;Farmyard dung is the best of all
fertilisers, and this should be used, as has been
pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> when the beds are being made, so that
there is plenty of good nutriment below the roots.
Nitrate of soda and Guano, both soluble, may be
sprinkled on the surface alternately once a week after
the plants have begun to grow, and hoed in. Manure
put on for a mulch in winter does little or no good.
The very best and only mulch, winter and summer,
is a loose soil surface; and for this the hoe must be
kept at work, especially after rain or watering. A
good liquid manure is made by putting a barrowful
of fresh cow manure into a large barrel, <i>a big wine
pipe</i> is the thing; add soft water to thin it, put in
a bag of soot, and fill up with rain-water. After
settling, this will be ready for use. Liquid manure
must not be given when the soil is dry, but only
after rain or a good watering. Soot dusted over the
beds is beneficial, and may also destroy a certain
amount of Mildew. The drainage from the farmyard
should not be allowed to waste, as is so often
the case; but if well diluted it makes a good liquid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
manure. Do not apply the fertiliser close to the
stem, but distribute over the whole ground. Remember
when giving liquid manure the same rule
holds good, "Strong meat for men, milk for babes."</p>

<p>Strong growing varieties will stand more than weak
ones, and no liquid manure should be given to newly
planted trees. A dressing of Basic Slag in the autumn
is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Pests.</b><a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;These are many, and the remedies are few
and simple. Caterpillars, large and small, must be
hunted for daily and killed with finger and thumb
from April to July, however unpleasant the process
may be, or the most promising buds will be spoiled.
For destroying Aphis, which are very troublesome
some years, a solution made by boiling Quassia chips
in water, and adding soft soap when cooling, is often
used; though "finger and thumb" drawn gently up
the stem when the insect is first seen, puts an end to
those on the shoot; and finger and thumb is even
recommended for destroying Mildew on its first
appearance, though this cannot be done when there
is a bad attack.</p>

<p>Nothing in my experience equals Flowers of Sulphur
for Mildew, when distributed by an "Ideal" powder
bellows. This should be done quite early in the
morning, when there is a promise of a hot, sunny day.
If the wind is not too strong, the Sulphur will float
through the plants like a cloud of smoke, searching
into every part. This should be repeated once a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
week, and even before there is a sign of Mildew on
the leaves, prevention being better than cure. But I
know no remedy that will quite destroy it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><b>Exhibiting.</b>&mdash;If the grower wishes to exhibit his
flowers, he should follow the instructions here given;
and I would also advise the reading of the late
Rev. A. Foster Melliar's book on exhibiting, and the
Rev. J. H. Pemberton's&mdash;both most excellent books&mdash;which
enter more fully into particulars than space
allows me to do.</p>

<p>The number of shoots having been reduced,<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> it will
soon be time to gradually take away all the buds,
except the centre bud and one other. This also
must be taken away, as soon as the centre bud looks
healthy and free from damage. Very strong growers,
like <i>Florence Pemberton</i>, and those varieties having
a great number of petals, will do better if the buds
are not much thinned, or they will be coarse.</p>

<p>The N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S. definition of a good rose is: "The
highest type of bloom is one which has form, size,
brightness, substance, and good foliage, and which is
at the time of judging in the most perfect phase of its
possible beauty."</p>

<p>It will be necessary in the case of Hybrid Perpetuals
to select the bud, which should be about
three-quarters open, two days before the show (four
or even five days for Teas), and to tie up, not tightly,
the centre of the flower with Berlin wool, leaving the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
outer petals free, taking care that it is not wet with
rain, or even dew. Bend the shoot down, if possible,
and cover with a shade; some clean litter spread under
dwarfs on the ground will keep the flower from being
splashed by heavy rains. Teas are improved if covered
with a cone of butter paper, as well as the shade;
and some may be cut two days before the show, and
if put in a dry, dark cellar, will remain in good
condition. <i>Mar&eacute;chal Niel</i> will improve in colour by
being kept in the dark. The best time for cutting H.&nbsp;Ps.
is from four to seven o'clock the evening before the
show; they will lose a little in colour, but will stand
longer than if cut before six o'clock on the morning of
the show. Use garden scissors in preference to a
knife. When getting the blooms, cut the stem five or
six inches long, and remove the lower leaves, which
only fill up the tube and do no good to the flower,
and do not add to its appearance in the box. A
receptacle with water should be taken round when
cutting, and the flowers put in immediately and never
allowed to become dry (the water must not be cold).
The name should be attached at once.</p>

<p>The regulation size of the N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S. for rose boxes is
"4 inches high in front and 18 inches wide, and of
the following lengths (all outside measurements).
For 24 blooms, 3 ft. 6 ins. long; for 18 blooms,
2 ft. 9 ins. long; for 12 blooms, 2 ft. long; for
9 blooms, 1 ft. 6 ins. long; for 6 blooms, 1 ft. long;
for 8 trebles, 3 ft. 6 ins. long; for 6 trebles, 2 ft. 9 ins.
long; for 4 trebles, 2 ft. long." The lid should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
a depth of 9 inches to allow room for the blooms.
Boxes are supplied at a moderate price by John
Pinches, 3 Crown Buildings, Crown Street, Camberwell,
who also supplies tubes, wire holders, and shades;
they can also be obtained from horticultural firms.
The tray of the box should be covered with moss.
When the roses are all arranged for the night, give a
little air by putting a prop under the lid, and leave
the box in a cool place. When the boxes are placed
on the show tables, lift the lids sufficiently high to
get at the flowers. Each tube should be lifted and
the rose raised, taking care that the stem is in
the water. All damaged outer petals must be removed,
and the flower if full with substance in it,
may have the wool removed. Assist the opening
of the blooms with a camel's hair brush. A gentle
puff with the mouth at the centre will loosen tightly
packed petals. Care must be taken when "dressing" a
bloom, not to alter its character; for this, according to
N.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S., "shall count as a bad bloom." The ties must
not be removed from the thin ones (those with few
petals) until the last minute, when it is time to
remove the lids. It will be necessary to take a few
extra blooms in different stages of growth, to replace
any in the box that have expanded; for a rose
showing an eye gains no point. Care must be taken
that there are no duplicates, but all distinct according
to "schedule." Once exhibit at an important show,
and many lessons will be learnt which can only be
learnt there and then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
